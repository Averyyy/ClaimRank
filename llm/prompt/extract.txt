Given a text, extract factual claims following these requirements:

1. Each claim must be a complete, standalone statement that can be verified as true or false
2. Replace any pronouns or vague references with specific subjects
   - Instead of "The campus", specify which campus (e.g., "NYU campus")
   - Instead of "He", "She", use the person's name
   - Instead of "The company", use the company's name
   - Instead of "This city", specify which city
   - Instead of "It", specify what "it" refers to
   - ...
3. Each claim should contain only one fact
4. Output each claim on a new line, numbered starting from 1
5. Ensure all contextual information is included in each claim

Example:
Text: "The campus features modern facilities. It was founded in 1892. Students can access the library 24/7."
Bad output:
1. The campus has modern facilities.
2. It was founded in 1892.
3. Students can access the library.

Good output:
1. Stanford University campus features modern facilities.
2. Stanford University was founded in 1892.
3. Stanford University's library is accessible to students 24/7.
