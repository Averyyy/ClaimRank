0000,Ex-FBI chief Comey to testify next week in Russia probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russiaâ€™s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. In his first public appearance since Trump fired him on May 9, Comey will address the Senate Intelligence Committee in both an open session and behind closed doors, which would allow him to discuss classified information, the committee said on Thursday. Comey was leading the FBIâ€™s probe into the allegations, and his firing sparked a political uproar. Facing rising pressure, the Justice Department last month named Robert Mueller, another former FBI chief, as a special counsel to investigate the matter. The Justice Department and multiple U.S. congressional committees are investigating Russiaâ€™s actions in the 2016 presidential election and questions about possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates. At next weekâ€™s hearing, Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Controversy erupted again this week after the Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, approved subpoenas to the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information relating to the â€œunmaskingâ€?of the names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. The White House and Nunes have alleged that former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration eavesdropped on Trumpâ€™s campaign, an assertion that Comey has disputed and current U.S. officials dismiss as absurd. Four current and former U.S. officials who have reviewed the materials told Reuters there was no evidence that political motives drove Obamaâ€™s aides to request the names be unredacted. â€œThere is no substance to this, so the only way to look at it is as an attempt to distract the headlines and the public from Comeyâ€™s public testimony and Muellerâ€™s investigation, both of which are serious,â€?said one of the U.S. officials familiar with the information Nunes subpoenaed. Committee aides complained Nunes had acted unilaterally, and the top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam Schiff, said Nunesâ€?actions violated his earlier decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said it appeared that Nunes was â€œmore concerned with pushing the White House narrative than seeking the truth.â€? Trump on Thursday renewed his allegation, without citing evidence, that his campaign communications were monitored, saying in a tweet: â€œThe big story is the â€˜unmasking and surveillanceâ€?of people that took place during the Obama administration.â€?Nunes followed suit hours later, tweeting: â€œSeeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americansâ€?civil liberties via unmaskings.â€?The names of U.S. citizens mentioned in foreign communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies are normally redacted, or â€œmasked,â€?in intelligence reports. The requests to unmask the names of Trump associates underwent the same stringent evaluations that U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require for all such applications, and they produced nothing out of the ordinary, said the four officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At most, only one of the requests related to Russia in any way, and the rest pertained to other countries, two of them said. The requests involved between 30 and 40 top-secret reports on intercepted communications in which foreign officials outside the United States mentioned the Trump campaign and people involved in it, the officials said. The reports contained no evidence that any Americans were targets of U.S. eavesdropping operations, they said. Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their governmentâ€™s involvement. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Putin directed an operation that included computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election in Trumpâ€™s favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

0001,"Trump dismays, angers allies by abandoning global climate pact","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Trump, tapping into the â€œAmerica Firstâ€?message he used when he was elected president last year, said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. â€œWeâ€™re getting out,â€?Trump said at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden under sunny skies on a warm June day, fulfilling a major election campaign pledge. â€œWe donâ€™t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they wonâ€™t be,â€?Trump said. â€œThe same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance,â€?Trump added. Republican U.S. congressional leaders backed Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded Trump â€œfor dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administrationâ€™s assault on domestic energy production and jobs.â€?Supporters of the accord, including some leading U.S. business figures, called Trumpâ€™s move a blow to international efforts to tackle dangers for the planet posed by global warming. Former Democratic President Barack Obama expressed regret over the pullout from a deal he was instrumental in brokering. â€œBut even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; Iâ€™m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weâ€™ve got,â€?Obama added. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, said his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement â€œon terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.â€?He complained in particular about Chinaâ€™s terms under the agreement. International leaders reacted with disappointment, even anger.  â€œThe decision made by U.S. President Trump amounts to turning their backs on the wisdom of humanity. Iâ€™m very disappointed... I am angry,â€?Japanese Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto told a news conference on Friday in an unusually frank tone. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a rare joint statement the agreement could not be renegotiated and urged their allies to hasten efforts to combat climate change and adapt. â€œWhile the U.S. decision is disheartening, we remain inspired by the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies,â€?said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A summit between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top European Union officials in Brussels on Friday will end with a joint statement - the first ever issued by China and the EU -  committing both sides to full implementation of the Paris accord. Speaking in Berlin a day earlier, Premier Li said China, the worldâ€™s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, would stick to its commitment to fight climate change. Russia also voiced abiding support for the Paris accord, regardless of the U.S. withdrawal. â€œWe made the decision to join, and I donâ€™t think we will (change) it,â€?Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. In India, one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing major economies and a growing contributor to pollution, a top advisor to    Prime Minister Narendra Modi vouched for intentions to switch to renewable power generation independent of the Paris accord. â€œThe prime minister is very keen on this,â€?Arvind Panagariya said. With Trumpâ€™s action, the United States will walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the pressing global issues of the 21st century. Syria and Nicaragua are the only other non-participants in the accord, signed by 195 nations in Paris in 2015. Fijiâ€™s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who is the incoming head of the U.N. Climate Change Conferences, which formalized the 2015 pact, said Trumpâ€™s decision was â€œdeeply disappointingâ€? Fiji, like many other small island nations, is seen as particularly vulnerable to global warming and a possible rise in ocean levels as a result of melting polar ice. U.S. business leaders voiced exasperation with the Trump administration. â€œTodayâ€™s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.â€™s leadership position in the world,â€?Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein wrote on Twitter. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils after Trumpâ€™s move. Under the Paris accord, which took years to reach, rich and poor countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels that are blamed by scientists for warming the planet. (GRAPHIC - The 2015 Paris Agreement to limit climate change: tmsnrt.rs/2f3oKDV)     â€œI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,â€?Trump said. Pittsburghâ€™s mayor, Democrat Bill Peduto, shot back on Twitter that his city, long the heart of the U.S. steel industry, actually embraced the Paris accord. The spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the action a â€œmajor disappointment.â€?The U.N. body that handles climate negotiations said the accord could not be renegotiated based on the request of a single nation. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking in Singapore on Friday, also called the U.S. decision â€œdisappointing... but not at all surprising,â€?adding that Australia remained â€œcommitted to our Paris commitments.â€?South Koreaâ€™s foreign ministry said in a statement â€œit is regrettable that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will undermine international responsibility and efforts to respond to climate change.â€?Trump said the United States would stop payments to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, in which rich countries committed billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with floods, droughts and other impacts from climate change. The White House said it would stick to U.N. rules for withdrawing from the pact. Those rules require a nation to wait three years from the date the pact gained legal force, Nov. 4, 2016, before formally seeking to leave. That country must then wait another year.  Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed disappointment and said in an email to employees that he had spoken with Trump on Tuesday to try to persuade him to stay in the Paris accord. â€œIt wasnâ€™t enough,â€?he said. Other business leaders warned that the U.S. economy would give away technological leadership. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said he was disappointed, adding: â€œClimate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.â€?Democrats also blasted Trump. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision â€œone of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing.â€?The United States had committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. The United States accounts for more than 15 percent of total worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, second only to China. Leading climate scientists say greenhouse gas emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and have caused a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. A â€œGlobal Trendsâ€?report prepared by the U.S. Director of National Intelligenceâ€™s office, released on Jan. 9, warned that climate change posed security risks because of extreme weather, stress on water and food, and global tensions over how to manage the changes.  Last year was the warmest since records began in the 19th Century, as global average temperatures continued a rise dating back decades that scientists attribute to greenhouse gases. Frank Rijsberman, Director-General of Seoul based Global Green Growth Institute expected international funding for investment needed to fight climate change would suffer, noting a $1 billion reduction in U.S. funding the Green Climate Fund in South Korea. Economists said the U.S. withdrawal would potentially cost U.S. jobs. China and the EU both already employ more workers in the renewable energy sector than the United States, according to the data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). â€œWinding back the climate agenda means that the U.S. will be left behind in the clean energy transition as other global players, such as in Europe and China, demonstrate greater commitment to deploying low carbon and job-creating solutions to climate change,â€?said Peter Kiernan, of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

0002,"Trump misunderstood MIT climate research, university officials say"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials said U.S. President Donald Trump badly misunderstood their research when he cited it on Thursday to justify withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.  Trump announced during a speech at the White House Rose Garden that he had decided to pull out of the landmark climate deal, in part because it would not reduce global temperatures fast enough to have a significant impact.  â€œEven if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100,â€?Trump said.Â   â€œTiny, tiny amount.â€? That claim was attributed to research conducted by MIT, according to White House documents seen by Reuters. The Cambridge, Massaschusetts-based research university published a study in April 2016 titled â€œHow much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?â€?showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.  MORE FROM REUTERS* World pledges to save environment despite Trump*Â Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils*Â Trump administration asks Supreme Court to revive travel ban â€œWe certainly do not support the withdrawal of the U.S. from the ParisÂ agreement,â€?said Erwan Monier, a lead researcher at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, and one of the studyâ€™s authors.  â€œIf we donâ€™t do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more and that would be catastrophic,â€?said John Reilly, the co-director of the program, adding that MITâ€™s scientists had had no contact with the White House and were not offered a chance to explain their work.  The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through country pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.  Under the pact, the United States - the worldâ€™s second biggest carbon emitter behind China - had committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.  A senior administration official defended Trumpâ€™s use of the findings. â€œItâ€™s not just MIT. I think there is a consensus, not only in the environmental community, but elsewhere that the Paris agreement in and of itself will have a negligible impact on climate,â€?the official told reporters at a briefing.  The dispute is the latest round of a years-long battle between scientists and politicians over how to interpret facts about the effects of burning fossil fuels on the global climate, and translate them into policy.  Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change and once called it a hoax perpetrated by China to weaken U.S. business.  ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge.  â€œClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,â€?Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the Presidentâ€™s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trumpâ€™s manufacturing jobs council.  Musk said on Wednesday that he had done â€œall I canâ€?to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that â€œas a matter of principle, Iâ€™ve resigned from the Presidentâ€™s Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal.â€?He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administrationâ€™s immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trumpâ€™s CEO Forum,  despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.     â€œI accepted the invitation to serve on the Presidentâ€™s CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors,â€?Fink said in a statement.  â€œI am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world,â€?said Fink, whose company is the worldâ€™s largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. â€œI do not agree with all of the presidentâ€™s policies and decisions, including todayâ€™s announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change.â€?Asked about Muskâ€™s resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that â€œanybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didnâ€™t solve the climate problem.â€?Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him  about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation â€œprovides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues.â€?In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it â€œwill not waver from our commitment to the environment.â€?It was unclear whether Ford Motor Coâ€™s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trumpâ€™s panel.  Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes â€œclimate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.â€?",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0005,U.S. environmental agency to offer buyouts to cut staff: memo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to offer some employees a buyout program to reduce staff, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, as President Donald Trump proposes slashing the agencyâ€™s budget and workforce to reduce regulation. The memo sent by acting Deputy Administrator Mike Flynn on Thursday said the agency wants to complete the buyout program by September. It did not give a dollar figure for the buyouts or say how many employees it hoped would take the offer. The memo was sent to all employees at the same time EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined Trump at the White House to announce that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. â€œEarly outs and buy outs ... can help us realign our workforce to meet changing mission requirements and move toward new models of work,â€?the memo said. â€œThe authority encourages voluntary separations and helps the Agency complete workforce restructuring with minimal disruption to the workforce.â€?The EPA would see the biggest cuts of any federal agency in Trumpâ€™s 2018 budget proposal, with a 31 percent reduction in budget and the elimination of over 3,200 employees. The EPA employs about 15,000 people.  In the memo, Flynn said the White House Office of Management and Budget must still approve the buyout plan. The EPA and other federal agencies have offered buyouts to employees from time to time in the past. Details on the selection criteria for employees in the pool were still being worked out, the memo said. Career staff at the EPA have been on edge since Trump took office, as the president vowed to undo major EPA air and water regulations in his first 100 days. Pruitt, who was an instrumental voice in convincing Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, doubts that human beings drive climate change and believes the agency should pare back regulations on the energy industry. The agency has also removed references to climate change and links to key EPA climate change reports from its website. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0006,"Trump's Paris decision followed debate between moderates, anti-globalists","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal followed an internal debate that pitted anti-globalist advisers like Steve Bannon against more moderate voices such as Trumpâ€™s daughter, Ivanka, and top economic adviser, Gary Cohn. In the end, Trump stuck to a promise that he had made on the campaign trail last year aimed at helping blue-collar workers who he feels are under siege in a changing U.S. economy. â€œI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Pars,â€?he said on Thursday in making his announcement. But Trumpâ€™s intentions concerning the Paris accord were unclear even to some of his aides until the last day or so, since he has shown flexibility on some campaign promises and had gotten an earful about the need to stay in the agreement from key allies at a Group of Seven summit last week in Sicily. At the White House, the behind-the-scenes debate about whether to stay in Paris or bolt was an intense one that dragged on for weeks. Ivanka Trump, whose husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior White House adviser, had been quietly urging her father to keep the United States in the Paris agreement, and had sought to ensure her father heard all sides in the debate, an official said. Cohn last week suggested Trump might be softening on his outright hostility toward the accord, telling reporters the presidentâ€™s position was â€œevolvingâ€?based on input from world leaders who wanted the United States to remain in the agreement. Kushner, on the other hand, came around to the view that the standards set out in the agreement did not work for the U.S. economy, a senior administration official said. The official said the question for Kushner was whether to try to change those standards within the agreement or pull out. Consistently in favor of pulling out were Bannon and Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller, who was involved in writing Trumpâ€™s Paris remarks, and Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Bannon and Miller are seen as key architects of Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?agenda, which is aimed at ensuring U.S. interests are taken into account over a globalist view. Although there had been some discussion of keeping the United States in the Paris accord, while changing its carbon emissions commitments, as a way of maintaining global unity, in the end, Trump decided to cut the cord entirely. â€œI think the presidentâ€™s legal team felt very strongly that it was best, that the cleanest way to address it was to just get out,â€?a senior administration official told reporters.

0011,U.S. travel sector to suffer if Trump reverses Cuba detente: report,"HAVANA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. cruise operators and airlines stand to lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel to Cuba, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a report released on Thursday. U.S.-operated cruises and scheduled flights to the Caribbean island were relaunched last year after a half-century hiatus, as part of the detente with Cuba pursued by former President Barack Obama. That may be under threat as U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration nears completion of a policy review to determine how far it would reverse that engagement. â€œRolling back expanded travel will cost airlines $512 million annually ... based on the average ticket fare,â€?Engage Cuba wrote in the report to which a host of Cuba experts contributed. U.S. airlines flying to Cuba include Jetblue, American, Delta and Alaska. Cruise operators, from Carnival to Norwegian [NCLH.O], stand to lose $200 million in revenue per year, Engage Cuba estimated, noting that thousands of jobs in both sectors were at risk. The estimate was based on lost revenue from fully booked flights and cruises. Eliminating cruises to Cuba could also cost South Floridaâ€™s economy an additional $212.8 million, given what passengers spend in port communities, Cuba Engage said. Supporters of the U.S.-Cuban detente are stepping up their lobbying to influence the Trump administration review. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators last week reintroduced legislation to repeal all restrictions on travel to Cuba, this time attracting far more co-sponsors. U.S. tourism to Cuba is still not allowed, but Obamaâ€™s decision to ease travel restrictions fueled a boom in American visitors under categories like educational travel. The number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1

Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron urged their allies to speed up efforts to combat climate change and said they would do more to help developing countries adapt. The three leaders tried to convince Trump last week at a Group of Seven summit to stay in the pact and honor U.S. commitments undertaken by the previous administration. In a speech at the White House, Trump said the U.S. would look to renegotiate the agreement and condemned what he called â€œdraconianâ€?financial and economic burdens imposed by the deal. The unusual French-Italian-German statement, released barely an hour after Trump announced his decision, underscored the disappointment of the eurozoneâ€™s three largest economies and their resolve to plow ahead without Washingtonâ€™s support. â€œWe are convinced that the implementation of the Paris Agreement offers substantial economic opportunities for prosperity and growth in our countries and on a global scale,â€?the three leaders said. â€œWe therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change.â€?In his speech, Trump complained that the Paris Accord required wealthy nations to help developing countries build renewable energy sources. France, Italy and German indicated they were ready to do more to help in the absence of U.S. funds. â€œWe will step up efforts to support developing countries, in particular the poorest and most vulnerable, in achieving their mitigation and adaptation goals,â€?the three leaders said.

0016,Trump budget chief under fire over attack on Congressional budget analysts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White Houseâ€™s budget chief came under fire on Thursday from Democrats and others over his attack on the budget research office of the U.S. Congress, escalating tensions between Republicans and professional staffers on Capitol Hill. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called â€œabsurdâ€?a recent finding by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a Republican healthcare bill would cause 23 million people to lose health insurance coverage. In an interview on Wednesday with the Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, Mulvaney said, â€œAt some point, youâ€™ve got to ask yourself, has the day of the CBO come and gone?â€?Steny Hoyer, a Democratic House of Representatives leader, in a statement called Mulvaneyâ€™s comments â€œirresponsible and unacceptableâ€?and an â€œindication of a bully mentality.â€?The CBO is one of a handful of analysis units of Congress whose employees strive for political impartiality, providing  dependable and neutral information that lawmakers can use when making often complex budget, tax and other decisions. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, including Mulvaney, have been frustrated with the CBOâ€™s findings about their proposals to roll back Obamacare, the healthcare system put in place by then-Democratic President Barack Obama formally known as the Affordable Care Act. â€œWhen Trump administration officials either disagree with or do not understand the impacts of their own policies, they prefer to attack the nonpartisan analysts who are doing their jobs with integrity and expertise,â€?Hoyer said in a statement. Representative John Yarmuth, also a Democrat, said that Mulvaney had impugned the integrity of a CBO analyst in charge of the healthcare assessment and urged Mulvaney to apologize. The CBO was created in 1974 during a spending dispute between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican President Richard Nixon after he withheld funds for government programs that did not support his political positions. A CBO spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday. Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican who headed the office under President George W. Bush, said it was not unusual for the office to become a â€œpolitical football.â€?â€œWhatâ€™s unusual here is to have the sitting OMB director attack the integrity, the core of the institution,â€?he said.

0019,"U.S. coal stocks fall; exit from climate deal may hurt, not help"," (This version of the May 31st story removes fourth paragraph, which does not reflect Peabodyâ€™s current position on Paris accord) By Rodrigo Campos and Nichola Groom NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. coal company shares dipped alongside renewable energy stocks on Wednesday after reports that President Donald Trump plans to pull the United States from a global accord on fighting climate change. The market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a U.S. exit from the Paris Climate Agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the United States. Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal company dropped 2.2 percent to $24.29 a share, while Arch Coal fell 0.4 percent to $70.77. A spokesman for Peabody said the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the â€œaccord is flawed on a number of levels.â€?Cloud Peak Energy Inc had also urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris deal to prevent other nations from an aggressive turn against the global coal industry. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $3.39. A spokesman for Cloud Peak declined to comment. A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that Trump is planning to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a move designed to help boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth, after weeks of deliberations on the issue.  Trump did not confirm the decision, but said he would make an announcement â€œover the coming daysâ€? A U.S. withdrawal would come over the objections of scores of big U.S. corporations - from Wal-Mart to Exxon Mobil - worried the move will complicate the business landscape instead of bolstering the economy. â€œFor us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change,â€?Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the companyâ€™s annual general meeting on Wednesday. Exxon had made that case in a recent letter to the White House, he said. Exxon dipped 0.7 percent, ConocoPhillips declined 0.2 percent, and Chevron Corp fell 0.6 percent. Crude oil prices fell to a three-week low on news that recovering Libyan output boosted OPEC crude output in May. Solar energy shares also got hit on Wednesday, with First Solar Inc down 2.5 percent, and SunPower Corp each down 3.4 percent.  â€œRegardless of what the President decides on the accord, we expect Americaâ€™s solar industry to continue to thrive and create jobs, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,â€?the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. Shares of Tesla Inc, which recently acquired SolarCity, were up 1.8 percent at $341.01. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he had done â€œall I canâ€?to convince Trump to stay in the Paris accord, and threatened to leave White House advisory councils if Trump announces a U.S. exit.  Trump campaigned on a promise to unravel Obama-era climate regulations to help boost domestic oil, gas and coal production. Company executives, economists, and analysts have expressed skepticism, however, that his deregulatory agenda can alter existing trends away from coal. U.S. carbon emissions have declined to near 30-year lows, a trend driven by increased natural gas use replacing coal. The VanEck Vectors Coal exchange-traded fund fell 1.2 percent to $12.71, not far from a five-month low hit earlier in May. The ETF is on track to fall 7.2 percent this month after rising in the first three months of the year as part of the so-called Trump trade. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1

0023,FCC to vote on revising rules on identifying threatening calls,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said Thursday it will take up a proposal this month to revise its rules to allow law enforcement personnel to identify threatening callers, following a series of threatening calls to Jewish community centers. In March, the FCC granted an emergency temporary waiver to Jewish community centers and telecommunications carriers that serve them to help track down callers who have made threats by unmasking phone numbers used to call in threats. FCC rules generally require phone companies to respect a calling partyâ€™s request to have caller-ID information blocked from the party receiving the call. Jewish community centers and schools in at least 13 U.S. states reported receiving bomb threats this year, stoking fears of a resurgence of anti-Semitism. The â€œepisode raised the question of whether we need to make permanent changes to our rules,â€?FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a blog post Thursday. The FCC will â€œconsider a proposal to change the rules to ensure that all threatened parties and associated law enforcement personnel have quick access to the information they need to identify and thwart threatening callers,â€?he added. In April, prosecutors identified an Israeli-American teenager accused of making dozens of bomb threats to Jewish community centers in separate criminal complaints filed in U.S. federal courts in Florida and Georgia that linked him to hundreds of threatening calls in 2015 and 2017. Michael Ron David Kadar, 18, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who is Jewish and lives in Israel, made at least 245 threatening telephone calls between Jan. 4 and March 7 this year, many targeting Jewish community centers in the United States, according to the Florida complaint. The FCC has only rarely granted waivers to access caller information. In 2015, the Middletown School District in New York state was inundated by phone calls making terrorism threats from anonymous numbers. Following the calls, then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler approved a special waiver in 2016 to access the caller information of the individuals making the threats. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0024,Trump delays moving U.S. embassy to Jerusalem despite campaign pledge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed a temporary order on Thursday to keep the U.S. embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv instead of relocating it to Jerusalem, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. After months of fierce debate within his administration, Trump chose to continue his predecessorsâ€?policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The White House insisted, however, that the decision, which is sure to disappoint Israelâ€™s U.S. supporters, did not mean Trump was abandoning the goal of eventually shifting the embassy to Jerusalem. But a U.S. official said no timetable has been set. â€œThe question is not if that move happens, but only when,â€?the White House said in a statement. With a deadline looming, Trump made the decision to defer action on the embassy â€œto maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend Americaâ€™s national security interests,â€?the White House said. Palestinian leaders, Arab governments and Western allies had urged Trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation, which would have upended decades of U.S. policy by granting what would have been seen as de facto U.S. recognition of Israelâ€™s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital. â€œThough Israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time, we appreciate todayâ€™s expression of President Trumpâ€™s friendship to Israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future,â€?Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s office said in a statement. Taking a harder stance, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a far-right member of Netanyahuâ€™s coalition, said delaying the move would â€œdamage the prospect of a lasting peace by nurturing false expectations among the Palestinians regarding the division of Jerusalem, which will never happen.â€?Nabil Abu Rdainah, a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Trumpâ€™s decision â€œreaffirms the seriousness of the United States in its efforts to achieve peace.â€?Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trumpâ€™s chances for achieving a peace deal that had eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to sites considered holy by the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Successive U.S. administrations have insisted that Jerusalemâ€™s status must be decided in negotiations. On the campaign trail, Trumpâ€™s pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trumpâ€™s top aides pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. â€œNo one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the presidentâ€™s strong support for Israel,â€?according to the White House statement on the signing of the waiver.

0026,UK's Farage 'person of interest' in Trump-Russia investigation: Guardian,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage is a â€œperson of interestâ€?in the U.S. investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, the Guardian reported on Thursday citing unidentified sources. The London-based newspaper said Farage had not been accused of wrongdoing and was not a suspect or target of the U.S. investigation. But it said he was â€œright in the middleâ€?of the relationships being looked at.  The newspaper said the former leader of the UK Independence Party had â€œraised the interestâ€?of FBI investigators due to his connections with Trump and Julian Assangeâ€™s Wikileaks, which published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the campaign. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on the Guardian story, and other U.S. officials said they were unaware of any serious FBI interest in Farage.  Farage said on Twitter it had taken him a long time to read the Guardian article because he was â€œlaughing so much at this fake newsâ€? â€œThis hysterical attempt to associate me with the (Vladimir) Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and Trump,â€?he said. â€œI consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia.â€?Accusations that Russia interfered in the U.S. 2016 presidential election have dogged Trump since he entered office and a former FBI chief, Robert Mueller, has been named as special counsel to investigate any collusion. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia used computer hacking, propaganda and misleading news reports designed to sway political opinion in an attempt to boost Trumpâ€™s chances of winning the White House. Trump has dismissed the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory. Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin, a former KGB spy, has denied meddling in the U.S. election.  CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Assangeâ€™s Wikileaks a â€œhostile intelligence serviceâ€?in April after it distributed material hacked from Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 campaign.  Pompeo said Russiaâ€™s GRU military intelligence service had used Wikileaks to distribute the material and concluded that Russia stole the emails and took other actions to tilt the election in favor of Trump, a Republican, over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. â€œOne of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,â€?the Guardian quoted one source as saying. â€œIf you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage.â€?â€œHeâ€™s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. Thereâ€™s a lot of attention being paid to him.â€?Farage, who campaigned for decades for Britain to leave the European Union, was a vocal backer of Trump, appearing on the campaign trail and meeting him in New York just days after the election victory.  Farage, who also attended Trumpâ€™s inauguration in Washington, met Assange in March this year at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where the Wikileaks founder has been holed up for five years.

0031,"Fearing Trump's next move, liberals urge Supreme Court conservative Kennedy to stay","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Liberal activists are urging U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative with whom they often disagree, to put off any thought of retirement, fearing President Donald Trump would replace him with a jurist further to the right. The liberal Democratsâ€?keep-Kennedy campaign, being pursued publicly and privately, reflects how powerless they have become against the Republican president when it comes to high court vacancies since the Senate in April reduced the vote tally needed to confirm a Supreme Court nomination to 51 from 60. It also shows how big the stakes are for both sides in any decision that Kennedy, who turns 81 in July, makes about his future on the court. If he were to retire, Trump would have a historic opportunity to recast the court in a more conservative posture, possibly for decades to come.  Some former Kennedy clerks have said he is thinking about retirement. He has declined to comment on his plans, despite requests from many media outlets including Reuters. Right now, Kennedy â€œis the most important man in America. He is the vote that swings the court on the most important cases that reach it,â€?said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a left-leaning think tank. Nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987 to a lifetime court seat, Kennedy has been a crucial swing vote on the nine-member court for more than a decade. On most issues, such as campaign finance and religious rights, he has voted with fellow conservatives. He also voted with the minority to strike down the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But on gay rights and abortion, he has sided with the courtâ€™s four liberals. If he stays in his post, the courtâ€™s long-standing ideological balance will be preserved. If he quits, Trump could replace him with someone who tilts further right, giving conservatives a solid five-vote majority. Wydra and other liberals are lionizing Kennedy and his legacy in the media. Some are reaching out to former Kennedy clerks and others who know him, asking them to urge him not to retire, said Michele Jawando, a legal advocate at the Center for American Progress think tank in Washington. One former Kennedy clerk confirmed being asked to urge him to stay on and said other clerks had asked him to do so. Other clerks said they had not been approached by liberal activists. Since he took office in January, Trumpâ€™s only significant domestic policy achievement has been winning Senate confirmation of his nominee to the high court, Neil Gorsuch, a former Kennedy clerk. Gorsuch replaced a fellow conservative, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. The Gorsuch confirmation did not shift the courtâ€™s ideological balance, but it did trigger a change in the Senate rules for considering Supreme Court nominees. To get Gorsuch confirmed, Republicans exercised the â€œnuclear option,â€?ending Democratsâ€?ability to use a procedural maneuver called a filibuster to block a final vote on a Supreme Court nominee. As a result, Republicans, with a 52-48 Senate majority, can now confirm any future nominee without Democratic support.  In another handicap, liberal groups said they lacked the money to sway public opinion via TV and online ads, unlike  conservative groups that had $10 million to back Gorsuch. In view of those disadvantages, People for the American Way, another liberal group, issued a report earlier this month outlining the impact of a Kennedy retirement, describing it as a â€œdisaster for the rights of all Americans.â€?Liberals want in part to protect the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. As a candidate, Trump said he would appoint court justices who would vote to overturn the decision. Perhaps seeking to reassure Kennedy that his legacy is in safe hands, Trump has consistently praised the justice. At Gorsuchâ€™s swearing-in in April, Trump called Kennedy a â€œgreat man of outstanding accomplishment.â€?Trump and other Republicans have said they have heard rumors that Kennedy might retire, but have not publicly urged him to. The president has vowed to pick his next nominee the same way he chose Gorsuch, from a list of contenders he made public before the election. Among contenders viewed as possible Kennedy replacements are federal appeals court judges Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman, conservative lawyer and former Solicitor General Paul Clement and Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, according to a person with knowledge of the nomination process.

0032,Vatican would see U.S. Paris deal exit as slap in face: official,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican, which under Pope Francisâ€?insistence has strongly backed the Paris climate change deal, would see a U.S. exit as a slap in the face and a â€œdisaster for everyone,â€?a senior official said on Thursday. At their meeting last month, the pope gave U.S. President Donald Trump a signed copy of his 2015 encyclical letter that called for protecting the environment from the effects of climate change and backed scientific evidence that it is caused by human activity. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin urged Trump in a separate meeting not to quit the Paris accord. â€œIf he really does (pull out), it would be a huge slap in the face for us,â€?said Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which has hosted numerous international conferences on climate change. â€œIt will be a disaster for everyone,â€?he told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica. In a telephone call with Reuters, Sanchez Sorondo confirmed the comments in the newspaper. Trump was due to announce his decision later on Thursday. A source briefed on the decision has told Reuters in Washington that he will follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the global agreement. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Sanchez Sorondo said he believed the U.S. oil lobby was behind the decision and that the industry had â€œmaneuveredâ€?Trump.  A withdrawal â€œwould not only be a disaster but completely unscientific,â€?he said. â€œSaying that we need to rely on coal and oil is like saying that the earth is not round. It is an absurdity dictated by the need to make money.â€? Trump has called the idea of global warming a hoax. In  March, Cardinal Peter Turkson, the popeâ€™s point man for the environment, immigration and development, urged Trump to listen to â€œdissenting voicesâ€?and reconsider his position on climate change. Former U.S. President Barack Obama helped broker the Paris accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month. Canada, the European Union and China have said they will honor their commitments to the pact if the United States withdraws. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0033,Egypt defends NGO law U.S. senators call a draconian rights crackdown,"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt defended on Thursday a new law on non-governmental organizations that three U.S. Republican senators have called â€œdraconianâ€?and a sign of â€œa growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissentâ€? UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raâ€™ad Al Hussein also criticized the law, saying it â€œeffectively hands administration of NGOs to the governmentâ€?     The law, issued on Monday after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. Cairoâ€™s foreign ministry denied the law aimed to restrict NGOs and said some of them â€œhave gotten used to working outside the law ... to defame the image of civil society in Egyptâ€? In Washington on Wednesday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: â€œPresident al-Sisiâ€™s decision to ratify the draconian legislation ... that regulates the work of non-governmental organizations is the latest sign of a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent in Egypt.â€? McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Graham said the U.S. Congress should in response â€œstrengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.â€?That sentiment was echoed by Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said the law would have a â€œterrible impactâ€?on Egyptâ€™s ability to make reforms and would have implications for U.S.-Egypt relations. â€œThis law is a direct attack on independent civil society in Egypt,â€?Rubio said in a statement. The UN human rights chief Zeid said on Thursday that the new law makes rights defenders even more vulnerable than before. â€œThe crucial function of these NGOs â€?to hold the state accountable for its human rights obligations â€?has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. This new law further tightens the noose,â€?he said in a statement. In Egyptâ€™s response, foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said: â€œIt is important to be vigilant about the intention of some civil society entities that have gotten used to working outside the law, and that were harmed by the issuing of the new law, to defame the image of civil society in Egypt.â€? Egypt is one of Washingtonâ€™s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. U.S. President Donald Trump praised Sisi after a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, saying the Egyptian leader had â€œdone a tremendous job under trying circumstance.â€?",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0034,"In Illinois, partisan politics send budget battle into overtime","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Any hope for a break in Illinoisâ€?long-running budget stalemate devolved into more partisan bickering and deeper divisions on Wednesday as the state legislature ended its spring session without a deal on a spending plan for a third year in a row. Democrats and Republicans blamed at each other for an impasse that gives Illinois the dubious distinction of being the only state to go nearly two straight fiscal years without a complete budget. A third budget-less year risks potential downgrades of Illinoisâ€?already low credit ratings. Citing Republican Governor Bruce Raunerâ€™s unwillingness to meet, House Speaker Michael Madigan, a Chicago Democrat, said budget talks will move to a June overtime session in which a tougher vote of a three-fifths majority will be needed for approval. â€œThe governorâ€™s reckless strategy of holding the budget hostage to create leverage for his corporate agenda that pads the profits of large corporations and insurance companies has for the third year left Illinois without a budget at the end of the May legislative session,â€?Madigan said in a statement.  Rauner returned fire at a state capitol news conference. â€œToday weâ€™ve seen a complete dereliction of duty by the (Democratic) majority in the General Assembly, once again, a tragic failure to serve the people of Illinois, a tragic failure to pass a balanced budget along with critical structural changes to protect taxpayers and grow more jobs,â€?the governor said.  Democratic Senate President John Cullerton blamed Rauner for blocking a budget by trying to kill a bipartisan spending and reform package in the Senate and later being murky in his preferences for property-tax freeze legislation that he had demanded in exchange for supporting new revenue.  â€?Rauner) came in the middle of the process, told Republicans to vote no, didnâ€™t give support and the same thing happened in the House. The Republicans didnâ€™t vote for anything, and as a result, we donâ€™t have a budget,â€?Cullerton told reporters. The Senate last week passed a $37.3 billion fiscal 2018 budget plan that includes income tax hikes, a sales tax on services and spending cuts without Republican votes. That budget legislation was not taken up by the House. Illinois, the nationâ€™s fifth-largest state, has been limping toward the June 30 end of its second-consecutive fiscal year operating under court-ordered spending, stopgap spending, and ongoing appropriations mandated by law.  As a result, the stateâ€™s pile of unpaid bills has topped $14 billion. Rating agencies, which have pushed Illinois down the credit scale six times to a level two steps above junk since  January 2015, have signaled more downgrades are possible.  The stateâ€™s cash crunch has delayed $1.1 billion in payments to public school districts, led to big spending cuts at state universities, and put social services providers on life support. Before adjourning, the House and Senate approved a school-funding overhaul, legislation authorizing the sale of the stateâ€™s main office building in Chicago, and a minimum wage hike. Republicans opposed each measure, and none passed by large enough margins to fend off potential Rauner vetoes. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1

0036,Fed official says U.S. immigration crackdown could hit economy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s crackdown on illegal immigrants will likely weaken overall U.S. consumer spending and economic growth as those targeted for arrest increasingly choose to stay home and save more, a Federal Reserve policymaker said on Wednesday. Millions of immigrants â€œare not going out and shopping, they are staying home, they are afraid if they go out they are not coming home,â€?Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said when asked about U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s months old directive.  â€œOn the margin - and itâ€™s too soon for the data to pick it up, but you hear it anecdotally - I believe we are going to see it, I believe those people are more likely to save than to spend,â€?he added at the Council on Foreign Relations. â€œAnd those two effects have some muting effect on consumer spending and therefore GDP growth.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1

0038,"Trump administration approves tougher visa vetting, including social media checks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has rolled out a new questionnaire for U.S. visa applicants worldwide that asks for social media handles for the last five years and biographical information going back 15 years. The new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, was approved on May 23 by the Office of Management and Budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.  Critics argued that the new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the United States. Under the new procedures, consular officials can request all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (bit.ly/2qBSrpv) Officials will request the additional information when they determine â€œthat such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting,â€?a State Department official said on Wednesday. The State Department said earlier the tighter vetting would apply to visa applicants â€œwho have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities.â€?President Donald Trump has vowed to increase national security and border protections, proposing to give more money to the military and make Mexico pay to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. He has tried to implement a temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations that a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. The Office of Management and Budget granted emergency approval for the new questions for six months, rather than the usual three years.  While the new questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of an individual visa application. Immigration lawyers and advocates say the request for 15 years of detailed biographical information, as well as the expectation that applicants remember all their social media handles, is likely to catch applicants who make innocent mistakes or do not remember all the information requested.  The new questions grant â€œarbitrary powerâ€?to consular officials to determine who gets a visa with no effective check on their decisions, said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and president of the Iranian American Bar Association. â€œThe United States has one of the most stringent visa application processes in the world,â€?Yousefzadeh said. â€œThe need for tightening the application process further is really unknown and unclear.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0039,U.S. companies sign billions in deals with Vietnam,"WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. companies signed business deals with Vietnam worth over $8 billion on Wednesday, including power projects and jet engines from General Electric Co (GE.N) and diesel generator technology from Caterpillar (CAT.N), the Commerce Department said. The 13 deals were announced as Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc met with U.S. President Donald Trump as part of a three-day, trade-focused trip to the United States. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pledged to shrink U.S. trade deficits, said the transactions would include $3.4 billion in U.S. produced content that would support 23,000 jobs. But the Trump administration still wants more work from Vietnam to bring down a rapidly growing $32 billion trade surplus with the United States, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. â€œI heard from U.S. officials ahead of the trip that just signing deals with U.S. companies was nice but not enough,â€?Hiebert said. GE said on Wednesday it had signed deals in Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest single combined sale with the country in GEâ€™s history. GEâ€™s agreement with Vietjet Aviation JSC VJC.HM includes 20 jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. It also includes a 12-year engine service contract for 215 LEAP-1B engines on 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that Vietjet has ordered, GE said. GEâ€™s power unit signed a memorandum of understanding to build two 750-megawatt gas fired turbine power plants in conjunction with state energy group PetroVietnam, using the Blue Whale gas field. GE also signed a joint development agreement to erect an 800-megawatt wind power facility. Partners in the agreement are Phu Cuong Group and International Mainstream Renewable Power, GE said. Honeywell (HON.N) also signed a $100 million deal to supply VietJet with 98 auxiliary power units for the airlineâ€™s new fleet of Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 aircraft, including maintenance for 12 years. Caterpillar and its dealer in Vietnam, Phu Thai Cat, agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said. The technology would allow for remote function monitoring including fuel, temperature and pressure. The value of the Caterpillar deal was not disclosed. Hilton Worldwide (HLT.N) signed a deal worth $650 million to manage a 610-room dual-branded hotel in Vietnam, while port security firm Passport Systems Inc signed a deal worth $1 billion, with $420 million in U.S. content, Commerce said.

0040,Trump hails deals worth 'billions' with Vietnam,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump talked trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would create. The U.S. Commerce Department announced 13 new transactions with Vietnam worth $8 billion, including $3 billion worth of U.S.-produced content that would support more than 23,000 American jobs. These include deals for General Electric Co (GE.N) worth $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest-ever combined sale in Vietnam. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and its dealer in Vietnam also agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said.  â€œThey (Vietnam) just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam,â€?Trump told reporters at the White House. The Commerce Department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the $15 billion figure given by Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, adding that most of the total involved the import of U.S. equipment. Communist Vietnam has gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about Chinaâ€™s rising power. Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone â€œsignificant upheavals in historyâ€?but that the two countries were now â€œcomprehensive partners.â€?Phucâ€™s meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration. However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnamâ€™s favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was important to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, rising 77 percent since 2014 to $4.4 billion. â€œThe growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long-term trade and investment relationship,â€?Ross said. Trump, who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, said he would be discussing trade with Phuc, as well as North Korea.  Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. Hanoi has said it shares concerns about North Korea. In his Heritage speech, Phuc welcomed Trumpâ€™s plans to attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi. He called it a sign of U.S. commitment to the region and â€œan important occasion for the United States to assert its positive role.â€?In a reference to somewhat warmer ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump, who has been courting Chinaâ€™s support on North Korea, Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers, but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too. He urged Washington and Beijing â€œto act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations.â€?Vietnamâ€™s government said on its website Trump and Phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U.S. vessels, including aircraft carriers, visiting Vietnamese ports. It said they had expressed concern about the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei are involved in maritime disputes with China, which claims nearly all the strategic waterway. Taiwan also stakes a claim. â€œThey emphasized that parties must not take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of disputed structures,â€?it said, an apparent reference to Chinaâ€™s construction work. Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washingtonâ€™s  Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, its view was they were â€œnice, but not enough.â€?â€œThey want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis,â€?he said.   On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with Vietnam. He said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it. The deficit is Washingtonâ€™s sixth largest and reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture. On Tuesday Vietnamâ€™s trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, presented Lighthizer with suggestions to address some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, Vietnamâ€™s trade ministry said. Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, of which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.

0041,White House unveils list of ex-lobbyists granted ethics waivers,"The White House on Wednesday disclosed a group of former lobbyists working in President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration who have been issued ethics waivers, following a request from the U.S. governmentâ€™s ethics agency. The list of at least 11 waivers include White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and Trump's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to a chart issued on the White House website. (bit.ly/1LPKWx8) Conway is permitted to â€œparticipate in communications and meetings involving former clients which are political, advocacy, trade or non-profit organizations,â€?while Priebus, a former Republican National Committee chairman, is allowed to have communications and meetings with the RNC, the document says. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work. But the administration has the power to grant waivers to particular hires, exempting them from that restriction. Also on the list is Michael Catanzaro, a special assistant to the president and a former oil and gas lobbyist, who is cleared to weigh in on energy policy. Daniel Epstein, associate counsel to the president, â€œmay provide legal advice to the White House Office or any agency of the executive branch and to take positions adverse to Cause of Action Institute.â€?Shahira Knight, a special assistant to the president who formerly worked for Fidelity, a financial services company,  â€œmay participate in broad policy matters and particular matters of general applicability relating to tax, retirement and financial services issues.â€?Andrew Olmem, a special assistant to Trump who worked as an attorney to the Senate Banking Committee during the financial crisis, is cleared to join meetings with former clients involving Puerto Ricoâ€™s fiscal issues, along with a wide range of activities involving financial regulation. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), had promised in a letter on Friday that the White House would comply with a request from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to provide information on which former lobbyists are working in the administration.       Mulvaney said in the letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by OGE to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the agencyâ€™s director. Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of a five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the Trump administration granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request â€œhighly unusualâ€?and said his agency has the authority to take â€œcorrective action proceedingsâ€?against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to â€œensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions.â€?â€œOMB has never sought to impede OGE,â€?he wrote. Mulvaney closed the letter by saying the OMB did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1

0043,Kathy Griffin loses CNN deal after photos with fake severed Trump head,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - CNN fired comedian Kathy Griffin from its annual New Yearâ€™s Eve broadcast on Wednesday after she drew strong criticism for posing in photographs holding up the likeness of a bloody, severed head resembling U.S. President Donald Trump. The network announced the termination after earlier criticizing the photos as â€œdisgusting and offensive.â€?Griffin posted a videotaped apology on Tuesday night amid a public outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike over the images, including condemnation from Trump. â€œKathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself,â€?Trump wrote.     â€œMy children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!â€?The U.S. Secret Service, responsible for presidential security, has opened an inquiry into the posting of Griffin posing with the severed-head replica, a spokesman in Los Angeles said when asked whether the agency was looking into the incident as a potential threat on the presidentâ€™s life. â€œWeâ€™re aware of it and weâ€™re investigating it,â€?the spokesman, George Fernandez, told Reuters. He declined to elaborate. Griffin, 56, a two-time Emmy-winning performer known for her deliberately provocative brand of humor, has appeared since 2007 as co-host of CNNâ€™s New Yearâ€™s Eve broadcast from Times Square in New York with anchor Anderson Cooper.  CNN did not make clear whether it was cutting its New Yearâ€™s Eve deal with Griffin for just the upcoming 2017 broadcast or for good. The furor also cost Griffin a show at the Route 66 Casino Hotel outside Albuquerque, New Mexico. Management of the Laguna Pueblo tribe-operated establishment decided to cancel a one-night appearance by Griffin scheduled for July 22, a spokesman said. Griffin apologized profusely in a video message posted to her official Twitter account late on Tuesday, saying that as a comic she routinely seeks to â€œcross the lineâ€?but realized in this case, â€œI went too far.â€?â€œThe image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasnâ€™t funny. I get it,â€?she said, adding that she was seeking to have the images taken down from social media. â€œI beg for your forgiveness,â€?she concluded. â€œI made a mistake and I was wrong.â€?Celebrity news website TMZ published a behind-the-scenes video on Tuesday of Griffin posing with the model head for a photo shoot. She was seen reviewing the images with photographer Tyler Shields and jokingly saying, â€œWe have to move to Mexico today because weâ€™re going to go to prison, federal prison.â€?TMZ posted an image from the shoot on Twitter. â€œThis is vile and wrong,â€?Chelsea Clinton, daughter of  former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wrote on Twitter. â€œIt is never funny to joke about killing a president.â€?Trumpâ€™s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., called on sponsors of Griffin to condemn the comedian. At his daily briefing with reporters in Washington, presidential spokesman Sean Spicer declined to answer directly when asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to have hosted a White House visit by rocker Ted Nugent last month despite violent remarks the musician made in 2012 about then-President Barack Obama. Secret Service agents met with Nugent after the performer told a National Rifle Association convention in St. Louis that he would be â€œdead or in jailâ€?if Obama were re-elected. He also declared, â€œWe need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.â€?The Secret Service later said the matter had been resolved with no further action. â€œTo be honest with you, Iâ€™d have to look back and see what those statements were and what the reaction was at the time,â€?Spicer said when pressed for a comment on Wednesday. Griffinâ€™s firing by CNN drew widely divergent reactions, with one Twitter follower, Anand Elgie, calling her termination â€œover reaction,â€?adding: â€œshe had a bad moment of judgment... Trump bring out the worse in us all.â€?Another, Mark Dice, said CNN should have acted sooner. â€œThe fact that you waited this long proves your network endorses the assassination of our president.

0044,"Dispute erupts over House panel subpoenas for CIA, FBI","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A political feud erupted on Wednesday over the U.S. House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s probe of suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, with charges that the panelâ€™s Republican chairman subpoenaed the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency without telling Democratic members. Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to â€œunmaskâ€?names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. â€œSubpoenas related to the â€˜unmaskingâ€?issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committeeâ€™s Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minorityâ€™s (Democratsâ€? agreement,â€?said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, said Democrats were â€œinformed and consultedâ€?before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americansâ€?names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. SUBPOENAS FOR TRUMP LAWYER, EX-AIDE The spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on Wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for President Donald Trumpâ€™s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in connection with the Russia probe. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two menâ€™s firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. â€œAs part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records,â€?Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow. CNN reported on Wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with Kislyak during the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic sources in Congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe. The focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington,  where Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, CNN reported.  During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions testified that he â€œdid not have any communications with the Russiansâ€?during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the Russian government during the campaign. It was reported in March that he met with Kislyak twice during the campaign, once at the Republican National Convention in July and once in his Senate office in September. Sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his Senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign. He later recused himself from the Russia probe. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0045,U.S. says open to talks on protected status for Haitians,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday said he was open to discussing letting more than 50,000 victims of Haitiâ€™s 2010 earthquake stay in the United States past next January.  Kelly met with Haitian President Jovenel Moise during a brief visit to the island and he defended the U.S. decision earlier this month to extend a deadline for temporary protection from deportation for Haitians for six months that was set to expire in July.  â€œIt is not meant to be an open-ended law but a temporary law,â€?Kelly told journalists. â€œIt has been seven years since the earthquake, which was the reason TPS (temporary protected status) was implemented. I have committed to the president and the government that we can work together to go forward on any future extensions.â€?A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck near Haitiâ€™s capital of Port-au-Prince in January 2010, killing some 200,000 people. Immigration activists said the extension did not take into account the damage created by Hurricane Matthew, which killed an estimated 1,000 people when it struck the Caribbean nation last year. Some aid groups warned mass deportations could unsettle the country that has long history of political instability.  Kelly dismissed critics who said his visit was too short to develop a proper idea of Haitiâ€™s situation, saying that he visited the country â€œno less than 10, maybe 15 timesâ€?while he was based in Miami as the head of U.S. Southern Command.  â€œI would say to people who made those statements, well, they donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about,â€?Kelly said. Under U.S. law, the Department of Homeland Security can award temporary protected status to citizens of nations devastated by violence, disease or natural disasters. Sudan, Somalia, Syria, El Salvador, Nepal and Yemen all have been designated for temporary protected status. ",politicsNews,2017/6/1,1
0046,Clinton says Trump campaign likely guided Russians before U.S. election,"RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday she suspects President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign gave guidance to Russian government propaganda efforts during last yearâ€™s U.S. presidential campaign, leveling her most serious charge yet against the person who defeated her. The former Democratic presidential candidate, appearing at a tech conference near Los Angeles, said propaganda spread on sites such as Facebook helped cost her the election, and she urged Silicon Valley firms to move faster to stop false stories. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Echoing assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies, Clinton said the Russian government wanted to spread disinformation about her. But she added they â€œcould not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.â€?â€œGuided by Americans?â€?asked Walt Mossberg, a technology journalist interviewing Clinton on stage. â€œGuided by Americans and guided by people who have polling and data,â€?she responded.  Clinton was pressed by another journalist on stage, Kara Swisher, who asked: â€œBut youâ€™re leaning Trump?â€?â€œYes, I think itâ€™s pretty hard not to,â€?Clinton said. She said there had been a â€œmarriageâ€?of people who spread false stories with Republicans who had detailed voter data.  It appeared to be the first time Clinton had accused Trump of collusion with Russians. Earlier this month, she blamed Russian hackers and then-FBI Director James Comey for costing her the election.  In a Twitter post on Wednesday night, Trump responded: â€œCrooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.â€?In her appearance on Wednesday, Clinton slammed Trumpâ€™s ability to create distractions using Twitter. â€œItâ€™s the circus, right? Itâ€™s what a classic authoritarian does,â€?she said. Trumpâ€™s administration has been dogged in its first months by allegations his associates had inappropriate contacts with Russian government officials. A special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, was appointed to lead an investigation after Trump fired Comey. Moscow has denied meddling in the U.S. election. Clinton mentioned Facebook by name, saying the social media network was flooded with false information about her and that people were understandably misled. She said she would like to see Facebook curate its network more aggressively.  â€œI have a lot of sympathy at this point ... for people trying to make these decisions. I would just urge them to hurry up,â€?she said.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in November it was â€œcrazyâ€?to think that fake news on the site had influenced the election. Beginning in December, Facebook began introducing tools to try to prevent fake news stories from spreading. Clinton said that in targeting voters online, she was at a disadvantage because the Republican Party provided Trump with an extensive database, through an organization called the Data Trust, that Democrats did not have. â€œI inherited nothing from the Democratic Party,â€?she said. â€œI mean, it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it, the DNC, to keep it going.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0047,"Trump blasts Russia probe, touts ex-adviser Page over FBI, CIA","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump sought to insert himself into congressional investigations on Russia on Wednesday, urging lawmakers to hear from one of his former advisers, Carter Page, to counter testimony by directors of the FBI and CIA. Trump has been dismissive of probes by the FBI and several congressional panels into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with his  campaign. In a series of early morning tweets, the president quoted a letter from Page, in which he asked to address the House Intelligence Committee promptly and referred to what he characterized as faulty testimony from U.S. intelligence officials. Trump accused Democrats of blocking Pageâ€™s testimony, without citing evidence but referring to an unidentified report.  â€œSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, donâ€™t want him to testify. He blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing â€˜the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan...â€?Witch Hunt!â€?Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the former directors of the FBI and CIA.         Trumpâ€™s tweets came as his advisers are planning to establish a â€œwar roomâ€?to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his campaign. The White House said on Wednesday it would not answer any more questions about the investigations, referring reporters instead to Trumpâ€™s outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz. The presidentâ€™s penchant for tweeting could complicate White House efforts to tamp down the scandal if the messages appear to address the investigations. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, swatted back at Trump on Twitter with a reference to the presidentâ€™s acknowledgment to NBC that he was thinking of â€œthis Russia thingâ€?when he fired Comey on May 9.  â€œ@POTUS, appreciate suggestion on witnesses but feel you may not have probeâ€™s interests at heart. Ex: Firing FBI Dir because of Russia probe,â€?Schiff wrote. Democrats say Comeyâ€™s dismissal was aimed at hindering the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s Russia investigation. CNN reported on Wednesday that Comey would confirm reports that Trump had asked him to let up in an investigation of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s contacts with Russia in upcoming public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have urged him to tweet less and more wisely. U.S. Representative Sean Duffy said on Wednesday the Russia investigations were becoming too much of a distraction in Trumpâ€™s 4-month-old presidency. â€œI think the president should step aside from any comments, any tweets on the investigation and focus on the agenda that he ran on,â€?Duffy said on CNN. â€œStop tweeting about it, stop talking about it and get about the business of your agenda.â€?Page, who provided a copy of his letter to Reuters, said the House committee postponed an appearance scheduled for next week without giving a specific reason. Schiff said in a statement that he and the Republican overseeing the panelâ€™s probe, Representative Mike Conaway, want to review documents before interviewing witnesses.  Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€?conclusion that Moscow interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor, and the president has denied any collusion. Congressional committees have contacted a parade of Trump associates and advisers to request information in their probes. In addition to Page, they include Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former White House press officer Boris Epshteyn, personal lawyer Michael Cohen and informal adviser Roger Stone. On Wednesday, the House committee approved subpoenas for Flynn and Cohen. It also approved subpoenas to intelligence agencies seeking records showing which former Obama administration officials requested the â€œunmaskingâ€?of the names of Trump associates who were inadvertently picked up in top-secret communications intercepts. Flynn has also been subpoenaed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0048,Trump expected to delay U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected this week to delay relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, U.S. officials and a diplomatic source said on Wednesday, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. With a deadline for a decision looming, Trump is likely to  continue his predecessorsâ€?policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the sources said. Trump has yet to make his decision official but is required by law to act by Friday, according to one U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Barring a last-minute surprise, Trump is expected to renew the waiver. His administration intends to make clear, however, that Trump remains committed to the promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign, though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so, officials said. Asked whether Trump would sign the waiver, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Wednesday: â€œOnce we have a decision, weâ€™ll put it out,â€?adding there would be â€œsomething very soon on that.â€?While there have been divisions among Trumpâ€™s aides on the issue, the view that appears to have prevailed is that the United States should keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for now to avoid angering the Palestinians, Arab governments and Western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts. Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trumpâ€™s chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. PRO-ISRAEL RHETORIC The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to holy sites of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Shifting the U.S. Embassy would be widely seen as Washingtonâ€™s recognition of the Israeli position on Jerusalemâ€™s status, which successive U.S. administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. Former President Barack Obama renewed the waiver in December, setting off a six-month clock for Trump. CNN was first to report that Trump was expected to sign the waiver. On the campaign trail, Trumpâ€™s pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trumpâ€™s top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise, not only because it would be welcomed by most Israelis but to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. â€œThe president is still committed to moving the embassy,â€?one U.S. official said. â€œItâ€™s not a question of whether but when it will be done.â€?The Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995 mandating relocation of embassy to Jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with U.S. national security interests.

0049,"Texas Governor signs Dallas, Houston pension bills","(Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on Wednesday a bill aimed at addressing public pension problems in the stateâ€™s two biggest cities, Dallas and Houston. The new law will increase retirement ages, hike worker and city contributions, limit cost-of-living (COLA) increases for retirees, and restructure governance.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Abbott wrote that he was â€œproud of the Texas legislature leading on pension reform that ensures fiscal soundness.â€?The Dallas police and fire pension system was projected to become insolvent within 10 years if the city or the state did not act.  The new law cuts the Dallas systemâ€™s nearly $3.7 billion unfunded liability to $2.18 billion and boosts the funded ratio to nearly 50 percent from the current 36.8 percent, according to a bill analysis.  The Houston bill would help reduce the $8.1 billion unfunded liability in the cityâ€™s municipal, police, and firefighter funds by reducing benefits. The law also lowers the fundâ€™s assumed rate of investment return from as high as 8.5 percent, one of the most ambitious rates in the country, to 7.25 percent, closer to nationâ€™s average.  The city of Houston estimated that without any type of reform, the city would contribute $3.7 billion to the pension systems over five years. With reforms, the city will contribute $2.0 billion. The city estimates a savings of $1.4 billion, and an estimated debt service cost of $0.2 billion.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0050,World risks four-year legal grey zone if Trump quits climate pact,"OSLO (Reuters) - The United States could influence or even disrupt work by other nations to combat climate change until late 2020 even if President Donald Trump quits a global agreement, legal scholars said on Wednesday. Trump will honor a campaign pledge to pull out of the 195-nation Paris Agreement, a source briefed on the decision told Reuters on Tuesday. Trump tweeted he would announce his formal decision â€œover the next few daysâ€? U.N. rules for the 2015 pact, which seeks to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century, say Washington would formally have to wait until November 2020 to withdraw. Trump could shorten the formalities to just one year by exiting Parisâ€?1992 parent treaty. Quitting the Paris Agreement would leave Trump in a legal grey zone until the next U.S. presidential election in 2020, retaining a vote as other nations work on detailed rules on issues such as how to monitor greenhouse gas emissions. In the worst case â€œthe U.S. could make it more difficult to adopt the Paris rulesâ€? said Daniel Bodansky, a law professor at Arizona State University. â€œTo the extent that (withdrawal from Paris) is already going to harm relations with our allies, staying in and being obstructionist would be even more harmful,â€?he said. Trump has promised to promote the coal industry over renewables. Bodansky noted, however, that Washington did not try to obstruct other nationsâ€?work on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which obliged rich nations to cut emissions, after President George W. Bush angered U.S. allies by deciding in 2001 not to take part. Megan Bowman, a law lecturer at Kingâ€™s College, London, said the four-year waiting period was partly intended to insulate the agreement from a shift to a Republican presidency after Democratic President Barack Obama. â€œThe downside ... is that if they (the United States) are recalcitrant they are sitting at the table, able to obstruct or stall the process,â€?she said. Paris imposes few legal obligations before 2020 and has no sanctions for non-compliance. The Paris Agreementâ€™s Article 28 says any nation wanting to pull out has to wait three years from the date the agreement gained legal force, which was Nov. 4, 2016, before seeking to leave. It then has to wait another year. In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that withdrawal would take years. â€œThe Americans canâ€™t just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesnâ€™t know the details.â€?Trump would be taking a riskier step by withdrawing from Parisâ€?parent treaty, the 1992 Climate Convention, even though it would require only a yearâ€™s notice and void U.S. commitments under Paris. That Convention, seeking voluntary actions to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and a landmark in cooperation between rich and poor nations, has had bipartisan U.S. support. It was signed by Republican President George Bush. Paris goes one step further by obliging all nations to set domestic targets to curb emissions to limit a creeping rise in temperatures blamed for more heat waves, downpours and rising sea levels. Leaving the Convention would make the United States an â€œinternational pariah on global climate changeâ€? said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard Universityâ€™s environmental economics program. Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said a U.S. presence in the Paris negotiations until 2020 would be â€œthe most negative thing ... they would still be allowed to vote in the roomâ€? But he said a quick, clean break by the United States from the 1992 Convention might be best for other nations which could then work without risks of obstruction. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0051,Ex-NAACP chief Ben Jealous to run for Maryland governor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former NAACP President Ben Jealous said on Wednesday he would seek the Democratic nomination for Maryland governor next year, charging that the Republican incumbent lacked the courage to stand up to President Donald Trump. Jealous, an ally of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, said incumbent Larry Hogan had failed to oppose Trump policies that would weaken healthcare and education as well as environmental protection of the Chesapeake Bay. Jealous, making his first bid for elected office, is the latest Democrat to try to link an opponent to the Republican president. Approval ratings have sagged for Trump, who has been embroiled in controversy since his May 9 firing of FBI Director James Comey who was overseeing an investigation into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia. â€œIt seems like every week our governor becomes a little more like the lion in â€˜The Wizard of Oz,â€?all strength and no political courage,â€?Jealous, 44, said as he declared his candidacy outside a cousinâ€™s flower shop in Baltimore. Hogan, who did not endorse Trump in the 2016 election, has not said if he will seek re-election. A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won Maryland by 26 percentage points in last Novemberâ€™s election. Jealous led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the biggest U.S. civil rights group, from 2008 to 2013. He is the second Democrat to announce his candidacy ahead of Marylandâ€™s June 2018 primary, joining entrepreneur and author Alec Ross. Jealous, if elected, would be Marylandâ€™s first black governor. Jealous, who spearheaded the NAACPâ€™s successful campaign to overturn Marylandâ€™s death penalty in 2012, said he backed raising the minimum wage to $15 a hour from the current $8.75, improving teacher quality, expanding mass transit and improving training for police officers. Hogan has followed a moderate agenda focused on economic growth and cutting regulations and fees. He also has banned fracking, which involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into shale to release natural gas and oil, thus aligning himself with Marylandâ€™s heavily Democratic voter base. He held a 65 percent approval rating among registered voters in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in March, but only 41 percent backed him for a second term. Hogan, 61, scored an upset victory in 2014 over Democratic Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1

0055,VA chief presses Congress to make it easier to fire workers for misconduct,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin urged Congress on Wednesday to pass a law that would let him respond more quickly to employee misconduct, such as the case of a psychiatrist who was caught watching pornography on an iPad while seeing a patient. Shulkin, in a briefing on the state of the department, said that veteransâ€?access to medical care had improved significantly since a scandal over wait times three years ago prompted the resignation of a VA secretary and forced major reforms.   But Shulkin, who served as undersecretary of Veterans Affairs for Health in the Obama administration, said a review of 137 studies and assessments identified 13 areas of â€œsignificant risk,â€?including rules that keep the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from moving quickly to fire employees for misconduct. â€œWe currently have 1,500 disciplinary actions that are pending, meaning people that either need to be fired, demoted (or) suspended without pay for violating our core values,â€?Shulkin told reporters. â€œOur accountability processes are clearly broken. We have to wait more than a month to fire a psychiatrist who was caught on camera watching pornography using his iPad while seeing a veteran,â€?Shulkin said. A VA news release on March 31 said an internal review recommended that the person be dismissed, but the law requires a  30-day waiting period before a final decision can be carried out. It said the psychiatrist was removed from patient care and placed on administrative duties. â€œWe need new accountability legislation, and we need that now,â€?Shulkin said. In a case in Puerto Rico, he said, the department was forced to take back an employee who had been convicted of driving under the influence several times and had served a 60-day jail term. Shulkin also warned that Veterans Affairs buildings were falling into disrepair and needed more than $18 billion worth of repairs. VA buildings on average are 60 years old and include 449 from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. He said 591 others are from the First World War era. The VA spends $25 million a year maintaining 400 vacant buildings and 735 underutilized facilities, Shulkin said. Shulkin said the departmentâ€™s computer systems also needed modernization. He said he planned to make major decisions on upgrading the systems by July this year. ",politicsNews,2017/5/31,1
0056,Comey to confirm Trump pressured him on Flynn investigation: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey plans to confirm reports that President Donald Trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s ties to Russia in congressional testimony, CNN said on Wednesday, citing an unidentified source close to the issue. The Senate Intelligence Committee said on May 19 that Comey, who was fired by Trump 10 days earlier, would testify before the panel publicly at some point after Mondayâ€™s Memorial Day holiday. CNN said the testimony could come as early as next week. Representatives of the committee would not comment on the report. After Comeyâ€™s dismissal, news reports emerged that Trump asked Comey to end the Flynn probe during a February meeting in the Oval Office the day after Flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting.  The Comey memo caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. CNN reported that Comey has discussed the parameters of his congressional testimony with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has taken over the criminal investigation. It said Comey planned to meet with Mueller, a longtime colleague at the Justice Department and also a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for a formal interview  after his public testimony. â€œThe Committee welcomes the testimony of former Director Comey, but does not have an announcement to make at this time,â€?said Rebecca Glover, spokeswoman for Republican committee Chairman Richard Burr.

0058,Talk of Trump pullout alarms backers of Paris climate accord,"LONDON (Reuters) - Reports that Donald Trump is about to quit the Paris accord drew calls on Wednesday for other countries to rally round the climate pact, but warnings from some environmentalists that it would leave the deal badly weakened. Trump will follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the global agreement, a source briefed on the decision told Reuters. On Twitter the president said: â€œI will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.â€?The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. The agreement has been criticized as far too cautious to hold back the rise in temperatures by more than a fraction of what is needed - but its defenders say its enrolment of almost all the worldâ€™s governments makes it crucial. Steffen Kallbekken, Research Director at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, called Trumpâ€™s move â€œmonumentally irresponsibleâ€? â€œIt is difficult to imagine a decision that would be a more devastating blow to the positive momentum behind the Paris Agreement, and to the prospects of raising climate ambition over time,â€?he said. Niklas Hoehne of Germanyâ€™s New Climate Institute said a U.S. pullout could corrode the resolve of other nations, perhaps including hydrocarbon powers Saudi Arabia and Russia. The big achievement of the Paris Agreement is that it was supported by all countries,â€?he said. â€œIf the U.S. is out that doesnâ€™t work any more.â€?Former President Barack Obama helped broker the Paris accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month. Trump has called the idea of global warming a hoax.     Canada, the European Union and China have said they will honor their commitments to the pact if the United States withdraws.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Spainâ€™s Mariano Rajoy in Madrid on Wednesday, and both countries reaffirmed their Paris commitments, without mentioning the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron said at a weekend summit in Italy he was sure Trump would back the deal after listening to his G7 counterparts. That hope appears to have been quickly dashed. At a Wednesday news conference, a government spokesman said Macron had told a cabinet meeting France would be â€œvery pro-activeâ€?in working to ensure the Paris accord was implemented.  â€œDepending on the stance some people or others are taking, weâ€™ll have to be very pro-active for France to be the homeland of the (fight against) climate change,â€?the spokesman said. Macron had â€œasked his ministers to take a number of initiatives, with our European partners or directly in Franceâ€?  European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said of a U.S. pullout: â€œIt would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind.  â€œThere is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that,â€?Sefcovic said.  Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament, sent a tweet in the literary style of the U.S. president: â€œTrump puts his ego ahead of the future of our planet - sad! Letâ€™s double down on our efforts to make the #ParisAgreement a success.â€?Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, called Trumpâ€™s decision â€œirresponsible and egoisticâ€? â€œItâ€™s now up to the European Union, India and China to take the leadâ€?on climate change, he said.  â€œThe U.S. is going from being a global leader to putting itself in a very destructive minority position.â€?But he predicted the deal would survive without Washington. Denmarkâ€™s energy and climate minister Lars Christian Lilleholt told Reuters: â€œIt will be necessary for the EU to show leadership if the U.S. should pull out of the deal.â€? Judy Wakhungu, Kenyaâ€™s cabinet secretary for environment and natural resources, said her government would be â€œvery disappointedâ€?by a U.S. withdrawal and hoped it could be reversed. â€œWe all live on the same Earth and face the same challenges,â€?she added.     Friends of the Earthâ€™s U.S. president Erich Pica said: â€œBy pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump will make the United States the worldâ€™s foremost climate villain.â€?Some observers saw chances that Washington would not, in the end, pull out.  â€œI hope that the president will be swayed instead by the rather sensible advice he is receiving from his Secretary of State, his Secretary of Defense and his Chief Economic Adviser, who have all recommended against withdrawal,â€?said Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.

0060,Factbox: U.S. carbon emissions seen declining over next decade,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump will follow through on a campaign pledge to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change, a source briefed on the decision told Reuters on Wednesday. U.S. carbon emissions fell last year to a 24-year-low and are expected to continue declining over the next decade as power companies keep shutting old coal plants to generate more electricity from natural gas and renewables. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projected total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy consumption would fall to 5,135 million metric tons in 2017, down from 5,171 million metric tons in 2016, lowest since 1992.

0062,Trump to broaden exemptions to Obamacare birth control mandate: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering taking steps to broaden the Obamacare limits on claiming a religious or moral exemption from providing health insurance that covers birth control, Vox news reported on Wednesday. The Vox website posted a copy of a draft of a new rule that it said the administration was reviewing. The rule would undermine coverage for one of the 10 essential health benefits covered by President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature piece of domestic legislation, which Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment and spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said it does not â€œcomment on alleged drafts of documents.â€?The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, employers are required to provide health insurance that covers birth control, except for religious houses of worship, which are exempt. Some owners of private businesses also obtained exemptions after the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object to the rule on religious grounds. Republicans do not have enough seats in the U.S. Senate to fully repeal Obamacare and as a result, the Republican strategy for rolling back the law includes stopping implementation of new health regulations and creating new administrative rules that undermine parts of the existing law. Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and other healthcare groups criticized the proposed rule and said it would make it harder for millions of Americans to access the healthcare they need. The ACLU threatened to challenge the administration in court if the rule becomes finalized.  â€œAny rule that allows employers to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees is an attempt at allowing religion to be used as a license to discriminate,â€?the ACLU said in a statement.

0066,Departure of communications aide could be first in Trump shake-up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s communications director is leaving the job, the White House said on Tuesday, as the president considers wider staff changes to try to contain political damage from investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign.  Mike Dubke confirmed reports he had resigned, saying in a statement, â€œIt has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration.â€?Dubke, who had been in the job just three months, gave no reason for leaving. Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, has been expected to shake up staff to tackle the firestorm over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and communication between Russia and Trumpâ€™s campaign and transition team.  Trump plans to bring in new aides to the White House, adding experienced political professionals including a former campaign manager, according to administration officials and people close to the president. Dubke, who was joined the White House in March to head the office that runs press and other public relations issues, oversees the White Houseâ€™s message strategy while spokesman Sean Spicer, a more high-profile figure, handles daily media briefings.  The Republican president came home to face more questions on Russia after media reports about communications during and after the campaign between his son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington. Spicer was asked on Tuesday whether Trump knew about reported efforts by Kushner in December to set up a back channel for communications with Russia. â€œWhat your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out,â€?he told a news briefing. Asked about a possible staff shake-up, Spicer said: â€œI think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda.â€? Dubke resigned just before Trump left on his foreign trip but will stay on until a transition is concluded, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said.        Other potential staff changes could be in the works, according to Axios News, which first reported Dubkeâ€™s departure, including fewer on-camera news briefings by Spicer, the White House press secretary.  Trump also will take more questions directly from the media, Axios reported.  â€œUltimately the best messenger is the president himself,â€?Spicer said on Tuesday. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the White House will continue to bring in Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to handle news briefings on topics in their patch. Conway also dismissed persistent speculation that Spicer, who has been pilloried on TV comedy shows since Trump took office on Jan. 20, was on his way out.  Controversy over the Russia issue deepened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, leading to allegations by critics that the president sought to hamper the agencyâ€™s investigation of the matter. Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€?conclusion that it meddled in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trumpâ€™s favor. The president has denied any collusion, repeatedly denouncing the probes by a special counsel at the Justice Department, the FBI and several congressional panels as a Democrat-backed effort to explain Hillary Clintonâ€™s upset defeat in the White House race. Congressional investigations into the Russia issue have expanded to include Trumpâ€™s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, ABC News reported on Tuesday. Cohen confirmed he had been asked to provide information and testimony to investigators in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate but said he declined because â€œthe request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,â€?ABC reported.  Cohen did not respond to Reutersâ€?request to comment. The White House declined to comment, saying Cohen is not an employee of the administration. However, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after failing to properly disclose his own contacts with Russian officials, told the Senate Intelligence Committee he will begin turning over some documents subpoenaed by the panel, a government source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Flynnâ€™s representatives told the committee in an email on Tuesday that they would start turning over some subpoenaed documents in time to meet a deadline set by the panel, and that more documents will be turned over later.

0068,"Merkel, minister stress U.S. ties after critical Trump tweet","BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Germanyâ€™s trade and spending policies â€œvery badâ€?on Tuesday, intensifying a row between the longtime allies and immediately earning himself the moniker â€œdestroyer of Western valuesâ€?from a leading German politician. As the war of words threatened to spin out of control, Merkel and other senior German politicians stressed the importance of Germanyâ€™s Atlantic ties, with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel suggesting the spat was just a rough patch. Trump took to Twitter early in the day in the United States to attack Germany, a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel ramped up her doubts about the reliability of Washington as an ally. â€œWe have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change,â€?Trump tweeted. The tit-for-tat dispute escalated rapidly after Trump, at back-to-back summits last week, criticized major NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse a global climate change accord. On Sunday, Merkel showed the gravity of her concern about Washingtonâ€™s dependability under Trump when she warned, at an election campaign event in a packed Bavarian beer tent - that the times when Europe could fully rely on others were â€œover to a certain extentâ€? Those comments, which caused shock in Washington, vented Europeâ€™s frustration with Trump on climate policy in particular. And while German politicians sided with Merkel, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel signaled that it was time for cooler heads to prevail. TIT-FOR-TAT, FROM TENT TO TWITTER â€œThe United States are older and bigger than the current conflict,â€?he said, adding that relations would improve. â€œIt is inappropriate that we are now communicating with each other between a beer tent and Twitter,â€?he said in Berlin. Merkel had already begun finessing her message on Monday, stressing that she was a â€œconvinced trans-Atlanticistâ€? a message she repeated after a meeting with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin. But Martin Schulz, leader of Gabrielâ€™s center-left Social Democrats, was less emollient earlier in the day when he told reporters Trump was â€œthe destroyer of all Western valuesâ€? He added that the U.S. president was undermining the peaceful cooperation of nations based on mutual respect and tolerance. In Rome, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said he agreed with Merkel that Europe needed to forge its own path. â€œThis takes nothing away from the importance of our trans-Atlantic ties and our alliance with the United States. But the importance we put on these ties cannot mean that we abandon fundamental principles such as our commitment to fight climate change and in favor of open societies and free trade,â€?he said.

0071,Trump jump starts search for FBI chief with two interviews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday was scheduled to interview two candidates to replace James Comey as head of the FBI, former agency No. 2 James Pistole and former Assistant Attorney General Chris Wray, the White House said. The interviews mark a re-start of sorts for the search to find someone to replace Comey, who Trump fired on May 9. Trump said earlier this month he was â€œvery closeâ€?to picking a nominee for the post and he had already met with several candidates. â€œThe president will be meeting with two additional candidates this afternoon, both Chris Wray and John Pistole,â€?White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. â€œWhen the president feels as though heâ€™s met with the right candidate heâ€™ll let us know.â€?Pistole, the former head of the Transportation Security Administration, served as deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2004 to 2010. USA Today was first to report that Trump would be meeting with Pistole. Wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Departmentâ€™s Criminal Division from 2003 to 2005. Comey was leading an FBI probe into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. His dismissal prompted an outcry from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers and raised questions about whether the president was trying to interfere with the investigation.  The week after Comey was fired, reports emerged that Trump had asked Comey to end the agencyâ€™s investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo of the conversation written by Comey. The Department of Justice appointed a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to head an independent investigation of the Russia matter. ",politicsNews,2017/5/30,1
0072,Path cleared for Congress to consider U.S. arms sale to Riyadh: State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized the State Department to notify Congress of the Trump administrationâ€™s sale of precision-guided munitions for Saudi Arabia to use in its Yemen campaign, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday. The notification is one of the last steps in the arms sale process and triggers a formal 30-day review to allow members of Congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation last week seeking to block about $500 million of a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, including the portion on precision-guided missiles and other offensive weapons. An announcement of the sale had been expected in March but objections from mostly Democratic lawmakers and human rights groups led to Washington to ask Riyadh for commitments to improve targeting procedures that would minimize civilian casualties. Asked on Tuesday whether the Saudis had taken specific measures to improve targeting capabilities, the senior U.S. diplomat, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones, did not answer directly. â€œThatâ€™s a continuing source of conversation between us,â€?Jones told reporters. â€œWeâ€™re constantly trying to improve that process.â€?The Yemen civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Nearly 4,800 civilians have been killed since March 2015, the United Nations said in March. Jones said Tillersonâ€™s authorization, which was expected, occurred just before President Donald Trumpâ€™s May 20-21 visit to Saudi Arabia. Trumpâ€™s predecessor, Barack Obama, in December limited military support to Saudi Arabiaâ€™s campaign in Yemen because of concerns over civilian casualties, and halted the sale of the precision-guided munitions. On his trip to Saudi Arabia, Trump received a warm welcome from Gulf Arab leaders, who want to crack down on Iranâ€™s influence in the region, a commitment they found lacking in Obama. Trump also did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia in his speech there, a move criticized by Democrats and Republicans in Congress. â€œThe fact that it wasnâ€™t featured in the speech doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s not part of the bilateral dialogue,â€?Jones said. â€œBy taking it out of the public debate and having those conversations directly and quietly, weâ€™ll be more effective.â€?Tillerson last week told reporters that human rights issues were not the â€œcentral partâ€?of Trumpâ€™s private meetings with  Saudi officials, which instead focused on the fight against terrorism.

0076,Major U.S. tech firms press Congress for internet surveillance reforms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and more than two dozen other U.S. technology companies pressed Congress on Friday to make changes to a broad internet surveillance law, saying they were necessary to improve privacy protections and increase government transparency. The request marks the first significant public effort by Silicon Valley to wade into what is expected to be a contentious debate later the year over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, parts of which will expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress reauthorizes them.  Of particular concern to the technology industry and privacy advocates is Section 702, which allows U.S. intelligence agencies to vacuum up vast amounts of communications from foreigners but also incidentally collects some data belonging to Americans that can be searched by analysts without a warrant.  â€œWe are writing to express our support for reforms to Section 702 that would maintain its utility to the U.S. intelligence community while increasing the programâ€™s privacy protections and transparency,â€?the companies wrote in a letter to Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representativesâ€?Judiciary Committee. Section 702 is considered a vital tool by U.S. intelligence officials, estimated to be responsible for as much as a quarter of surveillance conducted by the U.S. National Security Agency.  But it has long been targeted by civil liberties advocates as too expansive and lacking in sufficient safeguards.  Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, causing embarrassment for some U.S. technology firms. In their letter, the companies asked lawmakers to codify the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected American communications sent to or received from someone living overseas that mentioned a foreign intelligence target. Lawmakers should also require judicial oversight of government queries of data collected under Section 702 that involved American communications and narrow the definition of â€œforeign intelligence informationâ€?to reduce the collection of data that belongs to foreigners not suspected of wrongdoing, the companies said. The letter asks for more leeway in how companies are allowed to disclose the number of surveillance requests and more declassification of orders approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Legislation currently being drafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee is expected to address all of the concerns raised in the technology companiesâ€?letter.     Other signatories on the letter include Alphabet Incâ€™s Google (GOOGL.O), Cisco (CSCO.O), Twitter (TWTR.N), Uber [UBER.UL], Yahoo YHOO.O and Snap (SNAP.N). ",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1
0077,U.S. Supreme Court to hear Ohio's bid to revive voter purge policy,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear Ohioâ€™s appeal of a lower court ruling that blocked the Republican-led stateâ€™s policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots because it violated federal law. Civil liberties advocates who challenged Ohioâ€™s policy said it illegally erased voters from registration rolls and unlawfully disenfranchised minorities and poor people who tend to back Democratic candidates. The justices will review a U.S. appeals court ruling that Ohioâ€™s policy ran afoul of a 1993 law called the National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed to make it easier for Americans to register to vote. A Reuters analysis last year found that in Ohioâ€™s three largest counties, which include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters were struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods under the policy. Ohio officials argued that canceling registrations for voters deemed inactive for six years helped keep voting rolls current and accurate, clearing out those who have moved away or died. In September 2016, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled that the policy was unlawful. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of minorities, the poor and others who generally favor Democratic candidates. The American Civil Liberties Union last year sued Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted, arguing that the state was violating the National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits states from striking registered voters â€œby reason of the personâ€™s failure to vote.â€?The 6th Circuit agreed. Under Ohioâ€™s policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. If they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. Husted has said Ohioâ€™s policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. The suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015, including one of the lead plaintiffs, Larry Harmon, a software engineer and U.S. Navy veteran who was blocked from voting in a state marijuana initiative in 2015.  Republican Donald Trump won Ohio in last Novemberâ€™s presidential election. The National Voter Registration Act, dubbed the â€œMotor-Voterâ€?law when it was enacted, required states to permit registration by mail or when eligible people apply for or renew a driverâ€™s license, or visiting certain government agencies or military recruiting offices.

0078,U.S. senator calls for probe into promotion of Kushner Cos deal,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has called for an investigation into â€œpotentially fraudulent statements and misrepresentationsâ€?made by companies promoting investment in a property development involving the family company of White House advisor Jared Kushner. Citing a May 12 report by Reuters, Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, requested a review of claims made by Chinese migration agency Qiaowai and the U.S. Immigration Fund (USIF) in the marketing of the One Journal Square project in Jersey City, New Jersey to potential investors in China.  Grassley flagged his concerns to the Department of Homeland Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission in a May 24 letter that was later posted on his website.  Jupiter, Florida-based USIF contracted with Beijing-based Qiaowai to market projects including One Journal Square to potential investors through the controversial EB-5 scheme. The program offers qualified foreign investors the chance at a green card in exchange for a $500,000 investment in a U.S. business.  Kushner Companies is also working with KABR Group, a private equity fund, on the One Journal Square project, according to marketing materials on Qiaowaiâ€™s website. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of the funding, from EB-5 investors. Because the SEC considers some EB-5 investments securities, companies and individuals that market these investments must comply with U.S. securities laws.  EB-5 schemes must also comply with immigration rules. Under United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guidelines, EB-5 investors must put their capital at risk and the green card is not guaranteed. USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security. In an emailed response to a request for comment on Grassleyâ€™s letter, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for USIF, said: â€œQiaowai and U.S. Immigration Fund are fully in compliance with all laws relating to the sale of securities to immigrant investors.Â These allegations are gross distortions and unsupported by the facts.â€?Â  Reuters previously revealed that Qiaowaiâ€™s promotional materials online and on social media, including for the One Journal Square project, sometimes referred to a green card guarantee or â€œsafeguardâ€?and the safety of capital invested in EB-5 projects. After Reuters contacted Qiaowai for comment, these phrases were deleted. Qiaowai has also dropped the phrase â€œgovernment-supportedâ€?from its online promotion of the One Journal Square project. â€œIt is a fundamental rule of the EB-5 program that an applicantâ€™s investment must remain â€œat riskâ€?up to the end of the alienâ€™s conditional permanent resident status, and a â€œguaranteedâ€?investment fails this basic EB-5 test; if Qiaowai is in fact guaranteeing the safety of the investment principal, all related EB-5 petitions should be rejected by USCIS,â€?wrote Grassley, who has long advocated for reform of the EB-5 program. Qiaowaiâ€™s assurances to investors that their green cards were guaranteed and their funds were safe appeared to violate U.S. securities laws, Grassleyâ€™s letter said. It also cited a report on the projectâ€™s promotion by the New York Times. Kushner Companies and the SEC declined to comment. Qiaowai, KABR Group and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.  Chinese investors account for around 80 percent of the nearly 10,000 EB-5 visas issued annually.  Criticism of the program has centered on instances of fraud and the fact that most of the funds in a program originally intended to help impoverished areas have instead gone to wealthy urban districts. Despite these concerns, earlier this month, Congress extended the EB-5 program until September 30.     The Chinese road show for One Journal Square earlier this month also attracted criticism. Kushner Companies apologized for Nicole Kushner Meyerâ€™s reference to her brother, President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner, during the road show.  The company stressed that he was only mentioned in order to make clear that he was not involved with the project. Kushner Companies representatives skipped some later road show events. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/29,1
0079,China is behaving like a 'bully' in South China Sea: McCain,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China is behaving like a â€œbullyâ€?with its militarization of islands in the South China Sea, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain said on Tuesday, activity Washington must confront with its allies to find a peaceful solution. In a speech in Sydney, McCain said China was asserting itself globally, best illustrated by militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea, a claim repeatedly rejected by Beijing. â€œI think it is very clear that the Chinese by filling in these islands are militarizing them and that is in violation of international law,â€?the Arizona senator said.    McCainâ€™s comments are set to escalate tensions between the United States and China just days before delegates from both countries are scheduled to attend a regional security conference in Singapore.  China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway. The United States estimates Beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of land on seven features in the South China Sea over the past three years, building runways, ports, aircraft hangars and communications equipment. To counter the perceived Chinese aggression, the United States has conducted so-called freedom-of-navigation exercises, the most recent of which was conducted by a U.S navy warship near Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking Chinaâ€™s cooperation to rein in ally North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs. Allies such as Australia have so far refused to participate in freedom-of-navigation exercises in the fear of alienating Beijing. While McCain stopped short of calling on Australia to undertake the exercises, the former U.S. presidential nominee said allies must work together to find a peaceful solution.

President Donald Trumpâ€™s advisers are crafting recommendations that could call for tightening some of the trade and travel rules that Obama eased in his rapprochement with Havana but which are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. The policy review, coordinated by the National Security Council, is expected pick up steam now that Trump has returned from his first foreign trip, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump threatened in a tweet shortly after his election in November to â€œterminateâ€?Obamaâ€™s approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something its Communist leadership is unlikely to do. The White House said in February that Cuba policy was under comprehensive review and that human rights on the island would be a major part of any revised strategy. Obama implemented his Cuba normalization measures through executive actions that bypassed Congress, and Trump is believed to have the power to undo much of it with the stroke of a pen. But there are divisions within his administration over to what extent he should go, especially given that Obamaâ€™s opening to Washingtonâ€™s former Cold War foe has created opportunities for American companies ranging from telecommunications to airlines. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. businesses and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. A group of 54 U.S. senators reintroduced legislation last Thursday to repeal all remaining restrictions on travel to Cuba, signaling support for U.S.-Cuba detente on Capitol Hill. But the Republican administration has been under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart to take a much harder line than Trumpâ€™s Democratic predecessor. There is little support in the administration, however, for a full-scale reversal of Obamaâ€™s steps that began with a  breakthrough with Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014. Among the options under consideration are tightening restrictions on U.S. firms doing business with Cuban state or military enterprises and re-imposing stricter rules on  Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. It remains unclear, however, which recommendation will make their way to Trump,Â though the sources said a list was likely to be ready for his consideration in coming days or weeks. â€œWeâ€™re getting closer,â€?an administration official said. An announcement of changes could come as soon as June, according to the official and people familiar with the matter. The Daily Caller newspaper reported on Sunday that Trump would announce policy changes in a June speech in Miami, citing sources from a group opposed to the broader U.S. economic embargo that remains in place against Cuba. But the timing could also depend on factors such as whether Trump fills key Latin America posts at the State Department and elsewhere that remain vacant, sources told Reuters. The White House considered making a Cuba announcement on May 20 to mark the 115th anniversary of Cubaâ€™s independence, but that coincided with Trumpâ€™s overseas trip and the review also was not yet finished, the sources said.

0081,"In Texas legislature, tempers flare over immigration crackdown","(Reuters) - Tensions between Republicans and Democrats boiled over on the floor of the Texas Legislature on Monday as protesters filled the gallery on the last day of the session to denounce a new law cracking down on cities giving sanctuary to illegal immigrants. With the state House of Representatives in Austin preparing to adjourn, a bystanderâ€™s video showed one lawmaker appearing to shove a colleague as about a dozen others rushed together in an angry clutch before tempers cooled and the two sides separated.      Afterward, one of the legislators at the center of the confrontation said in a statement on Facebook that he was physically assaulted by a Democratic colleague while a second Democrat threatened his life. Republican Matt Rinaldiâ€™s statement said this occurred after he told Democratic lawmakers that he had tipped off federal agents about defiant protesters who were holding signs declaring their illegal immigration status. Rinaldi did not immediately return calls or emails seeking further comment. The incident highlights the raw emotions stirred by Republican efforts to put Texas in line with the priority that President Donald Trump has given to combating illegal immigration. Democrats, mostly representing urban centers that have defied federal policy, have condemned the crackdown.   Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. A bill, which both chambers of the Republican-dominated legislature approved on party-line votes and Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on May 7, aims to punish local authorities who fail to honor requests to turn over suspected illegal immigrants to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. It also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jay-walking.  Democrats have warned that the Texas law could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling. Civil rights groups have promised to fight it in court. ",politicsNews,2017/5/30,1
0082,Senator McCain says Putin bigger threat than ISIS,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said Russian President Vladimir Putin is a bigger threat to global security than ISIS, and warned that the Senate would push for sanctions against Moscow for its alleged interference in the U.S. election. McCain, a leading foreign policy voice in the U.S. Congress, was speaking in an interview in Australia, where he has held security talks on his way to a defense summit in Singapore. â€œI think he (Putin) is the premier and most important threat, more so than ISIS,â€?McCain said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp television. He said while there was no evidence the Russians succeeded in changing the U.S. election outcome, they were still trying to change elections, including the recent French vote. â€œI view the Russians as the far greatest challenge that we have,â€?said McCain, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. â€œSo we need to have increased sanctions and hopefully when we come back from our recess, the Senate will move forward with sanctions on Russia and enact other penalties for Russian behavior.â€?McCain, who has been a critic of President Donald Trump, said he believes the national security team around Trump is developing a strategy that will lead to â€œvictoryâ€?in Afghanistan, and Trump has great confidence in that team. â€œI do believe that most of the time that he accepts their advice and counsel. Can I tell you that he does all the time? No. And yes, does it bothers me? Yes, it bothers me,â€?he said. ",politicsNews,2017/5/29,1
0083,Exclusive: Tillerson declines to host Ramadan event at State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has declined a request to host an event to mark Islamâ€™s holy month of Ramadan, two U.S. officials said, apparently breaking with a bipartisan tradition in place with few exceptions for nearly 20 years. Since 1999, Republican and Democratic secretaries of state have nearly always hosted either an iftar dinner to break the dayâ€™s fast during Ramadan or a reception marking the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of the month, at the State Department.          Tillerson turned down a request from the State Departmentâ€™s Office of Religion and Global Affairs to host an Eid al-Fitr reception as part of Ramadan celebrations, said two U.S. officials who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  According to an April 6 memo seen by Reuters, the office - which typically initiates such events - recommended that Tillerson hold an Eid al-Fitr reception.  His rejection of the request suggests there are no plans this year for any high-profile Ramadan function at the State Department. The month of fasting and prayer for Muslims gets under way in many countries on Saturday. When asked by Reuters to comment on Tillerson declining a request to host an Eid al-Fitr event in July for Ramadan, a State Department spokesperson said: â€œWe are still exploring possible options for observance of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the month of Ramadan. U.S. ambassadors are encouraged to celebrate Ramadan through a variety of activities, which are held annually at missions around the world.â€? Muslim activists have accused President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration of having an unfriendly attitude toward Islam,    encapsulated by its attempts to ban citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.         The administration says that while it strongly opposes Islamist militants, it has no quarrel with Islam. Aides point to Trumpâ€™s visit this month to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam where he addressed the leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries, as evidence of that. Members of Congress, Muslim civil society and community leaders, diplomats from Muslim countries and senior U.S. officials usually attend the State Department Ramadan event, a symbol of the U.S. governmentâ€™s diplomatic efforts with Muslim countries and people. If Tillerson avoids hosting one this year, that could send a message â€œthat it is not as important to this administration to engage with Muslims,â€?said former U.S. diplomat Farah Pandith, who served in the Bush and Obama administrations and helped plan Ramadan events at the White House and State Department.     Tillerson issued a statement on Friday to mark the start of Ramadan, which he called â€œa month of reverence, generosity, and self-reflection.â€?â€œMost importantly, it is a cherished time for family and friends to gather and give charity to those who are less fortunate,â€Â he said.           Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright started the tradition 18 years ago of Americaâ€™s top diplomat hosting a public event for Ramadan, a lunar month. The secretary of state of the time usually gives remarks there on the meaning of Ramadan. In April, the State Departmentâ€™s Office of Religion and Global Affairs made a request to Tillersonâ€™s office that he deliver remarks at an Eid al-Fitr reception this year, and suggested a two-week range of dates in July. The event would serve to â€œhighlight State Department initiatives and the importance of Muslim engagement,â€?the memo said. It noted that by hosting a reception just after Ramadan, rather than an iftar - an often sumptuous dinner at sunset - a State Department event could be held any time of the day, thus preventing â€œa very late evening for the Secretary.â€? Several weeks later, that office and other offices at the State Department were alerted that Tillerson declined the request, the officials said.  Reuters was told of the request being declined but did not see Tillersonâ€™s reply. An official with the Office of Religion and Global Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.        Several prominent Muslim-American groups in the Washington area who are normally invited to the Ramadan event told Reuters this week that they had yet to receive an invitation from the State Department, which they said was unusual. â€œIf theyâ€™re having one, we havenâ€™t been invited,â€?said Rabiah Ahmed, spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Washington. A representative for her group has been invited to the State Department event in the past, she said. Trumpâ€™s administration has had a fraught relationship with Muslims. As a presidential candidate, the Republican urged a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, called for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were â€œtrying to take over our children.â€?Trump has since toned down his rhetoric and courts have halted his temporary travel ban on people from six mostly Muslim countries. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on whether they would continue the tradition this year of hosting a Ramadan-related event at the White House.     The State Department celebrates other religious traditions though some of those commemorations are not as well-established as the State Departmentâ€™s Ramadan event. In 2014, then-secretary of state John Kerry hosted the first ever celebration at the State Department marking Diwali, the Hindu festival. The White House also traditionally hosts annual Christmas and Easter events as well as a Seder dinner to mark the Jewish Passover. The top U.S. diplomat has personally hosted a Ramadan event every year since 1999, often in the State Departmentâ€™s grand Benjamin Franklin room, apart from three years. In 2006 and 2015, deputies of the secretary of state at the time hosted either an iftar dinner or an Eid al-Fitr reception.    In 2014, Kerry hosted a reception for Eid al-Adha, another important Muslim holiday. ",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1
0084,Trump attacks 'fake news' following Kushner reports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the news media and dismissed leaks from the White House as â€œfake newsâ€?on Sunday, following reports his son-in-law tried to set up a secret channel of communications with Moscow before Trump took office. Shortly after Trumpâ€™s remarks on Twitter, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly made the rounds of Sunday television news shows to praise any so-called back channel communications, especially with Russia, as â€œa good thing.â€?The Republican president returned to the White House after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe that ended on Saturday to face more questions about alleged communications between Jared Kushner and Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington. â€œIt is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,â€?Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday. In a statement later on Sunday night, carried by the New York Times, Trump praised Kushner and the work he has done in the White House. â€œJared is doing a great job for the country,â€?he said. â€œI have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person.â€?The White House faces mounting questions about potential ties between Russia and Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, which are also the subject of criminal and congressional investigations. Trump officials were preparing to establish a â€œwar roomâ€?to address an issue that has begun to dominate his young presidency. Aides said Trump was expected to meet with lawyers as early as Sunday, the New York Times reported. Two Republican U.S. senators played down the Kushner reports on Sunday, while the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, took a darker view of such contacts with representatives of Russian President Vladimir Putin. â€œMy dashboard warning light was clearly on and I think that was the case with all of us in the intelligence community - very concerned about the nature of these approaches to the Russians,â€?Clapper told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet The Press.â€?Kushner, who is married to Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka, had contacts with Moscow in December about opening a secret back channel of communications, according to news reports published while Trump was away on his trip. The 36-year-old Kushner, a real estate developer with no previous government experience, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. â€œWhenever you see the words â€˜sources sayâ€?in the fake news media, and they donâ€™t mention names,â€?Trump wrote, â€œit is very possible that those sources donâ€™t exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!â€?Contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials during the campaign coincided with what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trumpâ€™s chances of winning the White House. White House officials defended the concept of secret communications channels without commenting specifically on the Kushner case. National security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters on Saturday that so-called back-channeling was not unusual. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, carried the same message on Sunday. â€œItâ€™s both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable,â€?he said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€?program. â€œAny way that you can communicate with people, particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us, is a good thing.â€? Kelly told â€œFox News Sundayâ€?there was nothing wrong with the Trump transition team trying to build relationships with the Russians as they prepared to take over the White House. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said such secret channels may be used in situations including peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan or for the release of American hostages. â€œBut for people associated with the campaign after that campaign has ended and where the Russians during that campaign were helping you, to try to establish a back channel and hide it from your own government, thatâ€™s a serious allegation,â€?he said. Schiff was particularly concerned about a Washington Post  report that the back channel would have been conducted at a Russian diplomatic facility to avoid monitoring in U.S. communications systems. â€œYou have to ask, well, who are they hiding the conversation from?â€?he said on ABC. Schiff said he expected Kushner, who serves as an unpaid adviser to Trump, to appear before his committee and suggested his security clearance be reviewed. Kushner initially had come to the attention of FBI investigators last year as they began scrutinizingÂ former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s connections with Russian officials, the two sources told Reuters.   Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN he doubted the Kushner reports were accurate. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, noted that Kushner has been willing to answer questions. â€œThey reached out to us yesterday to make sure that we knew that was the case and Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s willing to do so,â€?Corker said on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€? Though he had not seen evidence of collusion when he stepped down on Jan. 20, Clapper said all the signs made an FBI investigation not only appropriate but necessary. â€œRussia, at least for my money, is our primary adversary,â€?he told NBC. â€œThey are not our friends. They are in to do us in.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/28,1
0085,U.S. might ban laptops on all flights into and out of the country,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States might ban laptops from aircraft cabins on all flights into and out of the country as part of a ramped-up effort to protect against potential security threats, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Sunday.   In an interview on â€œFox News Sunday,â€?Kelly said the United States planned to â€œraise the barâ€?on airline security, including tightening screening of carry-on items.  â€œThatâ€™s the thing that they are obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if itâ€™s a U.S. carrier, particularly if itâ€™s full of U.S. people.â€?In March, the government imposed restrictions on large electronic devices in aircraft cabins on flights from 10 airports, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. Kelly said the move would be part of a broader airline security effort to combat what he called â€œa real sophisticated threat.â€?He said no decision had been made as to the timing of any ban. â€œWe are still following the intelligence,â€?he said, â€œand are in the process of defining this, but weâ€™re going to raise the bar generally speaking for aviation much higher than it is now.â€?Airlines are concerned that a broad ban on laptops may erode customer demand. But none wants an incident aboard one of its airplanes. â€œWhatever comes out, weâ€™ll have to comply with,â€?Oscar Munoz, chief executive officer of United Airlines (UAL.N), told  the companyâ€™s annual meeting last week. Airlines were blindsided in January when President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days to citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, sending airlines scrambling to determine who could board and who could not. The order was later blocked in the courts.  In the case of laptops, the administration is keeping the industry in the loop. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said in a statement it â€œcontinues to be in close contact with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,â€?while Munoz applauded the administration for giving the company a â€œheads up.â€? â€œWeâ€™ve had constant updates on the subject,â€?he said. â€œWe know more than most. And again, if thereâ€™s a credible threat out there, we need to make sure we take the appropriate measures.â€? MORE SCRUTINY OF CARRY-ONS Among the enhanced security measures will likely be tighter screening of carry-on items to allow Transport Security Administration agents to discern problematic items in tightly stuffed bags. Kelly said that in order to avoid paying fees for checking bags, people were stuffing them to the point where it was difficult to see through the clutter.  â€œThe more stuff is in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at whatâ€™s in those bags through the monitors can tell whatâ€™s in them.â€?The TSA has begun testing certain new procedures at a limited number of airports, requiring people to remove additional items from carry-on bags for separate screenings. Asked whether the government would expand such measures nationwide, Kelly said: â€œWe might, and likely will.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/28,1
0086,McMaster says 'not concerned' after Kushner back-channel reports,"TAORMINA, Italy (Reuters) - Asked about reports that Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law had tried to set up a secret channel of communication with Russia before the president took office, U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said that so-called â€œback-channelingâ€?was normal. McMaster declined to speak specifically about the case of Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to Trump, but when asked if it would concern him if someone in the administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied â€œnoâ€? â€œWe have back-channel communications with any number of individual (countries). So generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner,â€?McMaster said. â€œSo it doesnâ€™t pre-expose you to any sort of content or any kind of conversation or anything. So weâ€™re not concerned about it.â€?Reuters reported last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between McMasterâ€™s predecessor Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador as Trump prepared to take office.  The Washington Post reported on Friday that Kushner participated in that conversation. ",politicsNews,2017/5/27,1
0087,Exclusive: Trump son-in-law had undisclosed contacts with Russian envoy - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. Those contacts included two phone calls between April and November last year, two of the sources said. By early this year, Kushner had become a focus of the FBI investigation into whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, said two other sources - one current and one former law enforcement official.  Kushner initially had come to the attention of FBI investigators last year as they began scrutinizingÂ former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s connections with Russian officials, the two sources said. While the FBI is investigating Kushnerâ€™s contacts with Russia, he is not currently a target of that investigation, the current law enforcement official said. The new information about the two calls as well as other details uncovered by Reuters shed light on when and why Kushner first attracted FBI attention and show that his contacts with Russian envoy Sergei Kislyak were more extensive than the White House has acknowledged.Â  NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was under scrutiny by the FBI, in the first sign that the investigation, which began last July, has reached the presidentâ€™s inner circle. Â  The FBI declined to comment, while the Russian embassy said it was policy not to comment on individual diplomatic contacts. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Kushnerâ€™s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said Kushner did not remember any calls with Kislyak between April and November.  â€œMr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. He has no recollection of the calls as described. We have asked (Reuters) for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information,â€?she said. In March, the White House said that Kushner and Flynn had met Kislyak at Trump Tower in December to establish â€œa line of communication.â€?Kislyak also attended a Trump campaign speech in Washington in April 2016 that Kushner attended. The White House did not acknowledgeÂ any other contacts between Kushner and Russian officials. Before the election, Kislyakâ€™s undisclosed discussions with Kushner and FlynnÂ focused on fighting terrorism and improving U.S.-Russian economic relations, six of the sources said. Former President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized Crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. After the Nov. 8 election, Kushner and Flynn also discussed with Kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies, two of the sources said.Â Reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place. Reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between Flynn and Kislyak as Trump prepared to take office. The Washington Post was first to report on Friday that Kushner participated in that conversation. Separately, there were at least 18 undisclosed calls and emails between Trump associates and Kremlin-linked people in the seven months before the Nov. 8 presidential election, including six calls with Kislyak, sources told Reuters earlier this month. . Two people familiar with those 18 contacts said Flynn and Kushner were amongÂ the Trump associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone. Reuters previously reported only Flynnâ€™s involvement in those discussions. Six of the sources said there were multiple contacts between Kushner and Kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between April and November and the post-election conversation about setting up a back channel. It is also not clear whether Kushner engaged with Kislyak on his own or with other Trump aides.  FBI scrutiny of Kushner began when intelligence reports of Flynnâ€™s contacts with Russians included mentions of U.S. citizens, whose names were redacted because of U.S. privacy laws. This prompted investigators to ask U.S. intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the Americans, the current U.S. law enforcement official said. Kushnerâ€™s was one of the names that was revealed, the official said, prompting a closer look at the presidentâ€™s son-in-lawâ€™s dealings with Kislyak and other Russians. FBI investigators are examining whether Russians suggested to Kushner or other Trump aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow Russian banks to offer financing to people with ties to Trump, said the current U.S. law enforcement official.  The head of Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, a trained intelligence officer whom Putin appointed, met Kushner at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under U.S. sanctions and was implicated in a 2015 espionage case in which one of its New York executives pleaded guilty to spying and was jailed.  The bank said in a statement in March that it had met with Kushner along with other representatives of U.S. banks and business as part of preparing a new corporate strategy. Officials familiar with intelligence on contacts between the Russians and Trump advisers said that so far they have not seen evidence of any wrongdoing or collusion between the Trump camp and the Kremlin. Â Moreover, they said, nothing found so far indicates that Trump authorized, or was even aware of, the contacts. There may not have been anything improper about the contacts, the current law enforcement official stressed. Kushner offered in March to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russiaâ€™s attempts to interfere in last yearâ€™s election. The contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials during the presidential campaign coincided with what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trumpâ€™s chances of winning the White House and damage his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

0088,Trump ends nine-day overseas trip with a flourish as trouble looms at home,"SIGONELLA, Italy (Reuters) - With trouble facing him back home, U.S. President Donald Trump ended his nine-day overseas journey in dramatic fashion on Saturday, addressing U.S. troops at a campaign-style rally. Trump flipped traditional U.S. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the Middle East and Europe, coddling Middle Eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional European allies pay more for their defense. At a Group of Seven summit in the resort town of Taormina on the island of Sicily, Trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement, insisting he needed more time to make up his mind. In a hangar at Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is also on Sicily, Trump was introduced by his wife Melania, who has raised eyebrows during the trip by twice flicking away her husbandâ€™s hand when he tried to hold hers. â€œMy husband worked very hard on this trip and I am very proud of him,â€?she said. Trump, whose Marine One helicopter landed from Taormina to the soaring soundtrack of the â€œAir Force Oneâ€?movie, emerged from two days of closed door summitry to declare his trip a success. Trump said he had helped forge more international cooperation in the fight against Islamist militants, a threat he said was underscored by a suicide bomber in Manchester, England, and the killing of Coptic Christians in Egypt. â€œIt was a tremendously productive meeting where I strengthen American bonds,â€?said Trump. â€œWe have great bonds with other countries and, with some of our closest allies, we concluded a truly historic week.â€?Trump skipped the traditional end-of-trip news conference to avoid facing questions about a host of problems he faces upon his return to Washington later on Saturday. His May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey has raised concerns about whether he was trying to squelch a federal probe into his campaignâ€™s ties with Russia last year. The questions have been intensified in the wake of disclosures on Friday that a senior adviser, Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka, had contacts with the Russians in December about opening a secret back channel of communications with Moscow. Trump used his trip to promote â€œAmerica Firstâ€?policies,  promoting $110 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and telling G-7 allies that the United States needs a more level playing field on trade. His body language on the trip demonstrated his typically brash behavior, dramatized by his demands that NATO allies pay more for their defense and his refusal to explicitly declare that the United States backs Article 5 of the allianceâ€™s charter, which requires each member to come to the defense of each other. His pushing aside of the prime minister of Montenegro to get in place for a family photo generated headlines across Europe. At Sigonella, Trump said his appeals to NATO allies to pay more was working. â€œMoney is starting to flow in,â€?he said. â€œItâ€™s only fair to the United States. Weâ€™re behind NATO all the way. But we want to be treated fairly.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/27,1
0089,Former U.S. national security adviser Brzezinski dies at 89,"(Reuters) - Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as U.S. President Jimmy Carterâ€™s national security adviser during the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and drove a normalization of relations with China, has died. He was 89. Brzezinskiâ€™s daughter Mika, a host on MSNBCâ€™s â€œMorning Joeâ€?show, said her father died peacefully on Friday. She did not give the cause of death. â€œHe was known to his friends as Zbig, to his grandchildren as Chief and to his wife as the enduring love of her life. I just knew him as the most inspiring, loving and devoted father any girl could ever have,â€?she said on Instagram.   Brzezinski, the hawkish son of a Polish diplomat, was national security adviser for all four years of the 1977-81 Carter presidency. The period saw tumultuous international events, including the Iranian revolution, the taking of 52 Americans as hostages in Tehran and a failed rescue mission, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Brzezinski was plucked by Carter from the academic world and saw many of the Soviet Unionâ€™s foreign policy moves as evidence it could not be trusted. That placed him at odds with two of Carterâ€™s closest  advisers: Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who pushed for a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT-2) with Moscow, and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who urged a U.S.-Soviet accord to curb conventional forces in Europe. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, Brzezinski strongly backed arming Afghan rebels. His hardline stance led Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, to denounce him as a â€œfoe of detente.â€?Carter said Brzezinski was brilliant, dedicated and loyal.  â€œRosalynn (Carterâ€™s wife) and I are saddened,â€?he said in a statement. â€œHe was an important part of our lives for more than four decades and was a superb public servant.â€?Former President Barack Obama called Brzezinski â€œan accomplished public servant, a powerful intellect, and a passionate advocate for American leadership. â€œHis influence spanned several decades, and I was one of several Presidents who benefited from his wisdom and counsel. You always knew where Zbig stood, and his ideas and advocacy helped shape decades of American national security policy.â€? In a joint statement, former President George H. W. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, hailed Brzezinski as â€œa great American ... a good man and a good friend.â€?While he was skeptical of Soviet motives and objectives, Brzezinski nurtured a diplomatic friendship between the United States and China, which culminated in a trip to Beijing in June 1978 that led to re-establishment of diplomatic ties. Brzezinskiâ€™s view of the Soviet Union may have been colored by his childhood experiences. Born in Warsaw, Poland, on March 28, 1928, he was taken as a youngster to Canada where his father served as a diplomat. When the communists took over Poland at the end of World War Two, the family remained in the West. Brzezinski received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1953 and became an American citizen in 1958. He voiced support for U.S. policy in Vietnam in the mid-1960s, and served on the policy planning staff of President Lyndon Johnsonâ€™s State Department. Along with David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, Brzezinski helped to found the Trilateral Commission, a private group that promoted closer ties between  North America, Western Europe and Japan. Carter had known Brzezinski before his election and asked him to leave Columbia University, where the effects of Soviet communism had been the focus of much of his work. Having regular access to Carter gave Brzezinski vast influence, leading to reports that he and Vance were rivals for the presidentâ€™s ear. The rivalry lasted until Vance resigned after the aborted mission to rescue American hostages in Iran in April 1980. Before the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, Vance had resisted Brzezinskiâ€™s proposal that Washington back a military crackdown against Iranâ€™s radical Islamic forces. Once the embassy was taken by followers of Islamic leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Vance sought Carterâ€™s backing for an attempt to come to terms with Khomeini. Brzezinski characteristically favored military action to free the 52 American hostages and punish Iran. Carter eventually accepted Brzezinskiâ€™s proposal for the ill-fated mission, in which eight servicemen died. Brzezinski also took part in negotiations toward the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979, which was seen by many as the major achievement of Carterâ€™s presidency. Despite his lifelong antipathy to Soviet communism, he joined Defense Secretary Brown in spearheading an unsuccessful drive to win Senate approval for the 1979 SALT-2 arms control accord. Although it never cleared the Senate as a result of the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, SALT-2 remained in unofficially effect beyond its original five-year lifespan. After the Carter years, Brzezinski became a consultant on international affairs and a senior adviser at Washingtonâ€™s Center for Strategic and International Studies. He also taught  foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University. He wrote frequent opinion articles for newspapers and published several books. These included â€œStrategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Powerâ€?in 2012. Then Vice President George H.W. Bush, trying to build an image as a tough foreign policy realist, considered it a coup to secure Brzezinskiâ€™s support in his 1988 presidential campaign. Brzezinski was at times critical of both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He was sharply critical of Bushâ€™s â€œwar on terrorâ€?and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After Donald Trumpâ€™s election in November, he observed that the world was watching U.S. political developments â€œwith some stupefaction.â€?Brzezinski had endorsed Barack Obama in 2007, saying the Democratic presidential candidate recognized the challenge of bringing â€œa new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of Americaâ€™s role in the world.â€?Brzezinski had three children with his wife Emilie.

0090,Trump travel ban fight heads toward Supreme Court showdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fate of President Donald Trumpâ€™s order to ban travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations, blocked by federal courts, may soon be in the hands of the conservative-majority Supreme Court, where his appointee Neil Gorsuch could help settle the matter. After the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined on Thursday to lift a Maryland federal judgeâ€™s injunction halting the temporary ban ordered by Trump on March 6, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration would appeal to the Supreme Court. A second regional federal appeals court heard arguments on May 15 in Seattle in the administrationâ€™s appeal of a decision by a federal judge in Hawaii also to block the ban. A ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is pending. The Justice Department has not made clear when the administration would make its formal appeal or whether it would wait for the 9th Circuit ruling before appealing.  If they take it up, the justices would be called upon to decide whether courts should always defer to the president over allowing certain people to enter the country, especially when national security is the stated reason for an action as in this case. They also would have to decide if Trumpâ€™s order violated the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s bar against the government favoring one religion over another, as the banâ€™s challengers assert. Gorsuchâ€™s April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate over Democratic opposition restored the courtâ€™s 5-4 majority, which means that if all the conservative justices side with the administration the ban would be restored regardless of how the four liberal justices vote. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gorsuch was questioned about Trumpâ€™s criticism of judges who ruled against the ban. Gorsuch avoided commenting on the legal issue, saying only that he would not be â€œrubber stampâ€?for any president. While the justices could decide in the coming weeks whether to hear the case, they likely would not hold oral arguments until late in the year, with a ruling sometime after that. A final resolution may not come until perhaps a year after Trump issued the executive order. The justices are not required to hear any case, but this one meets important criteria cited by experts, including that it would be the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction.  The administration could file an emergency application seeking to put the order into effect while the litigation on its legality continues. At least five justices must agree for any such request to be granted. While the court could split 5-4 along ideological lines, it also is possible some conservative justices could join the liberals in overturning the travel ban, libertarian law professor Ilya Somin of George Mason University said. â€œConservatives in other contexts often take a hard line against any kind of government discrimination (based) on race or religion or the like, even if the motivation may be benign. Also conservatives have concerns about government infringements on religion,â€?Somin said. The 4th Circuit said the banâ€™s challengers, including refugee groups, in the case argued by the American Civil Liberties Union were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violated the Constitutionâ€™s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any religion. In the 10-3 ruling, three Republican-appointed judges dissented. The Republican presidentâ€™s March 6 order, replacing an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, called for barring people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government implements stricter visa screening. It also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The travel banâ€™s challengers may take some comfort from the appeals court rulingâ€™s reliance on a concurring opinion in a 2015 Supreme Court immigration case by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the courtâ€™s liberals in big cases. In the 2015 case, Kennedy wrote that in the immigration context, the governmentâ€™s actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith. â€œAs with any opinion by Justice Kennedy, I think the million-dollar question is just what he meant in his concurrence, and this may be a perfect case to find out,â€?University of Texas School of Law professor Stephen Vladeck said. In Thursdayâ€™s ruling, 4th Circuit Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the plaintiffs had shown there was â€œample evidenceâ€?of bad faith, which gave the green light to probe whether there were reasons for the order other than the administrationâ€™s stated national security rationale. The administration has argued the temporary travel ban was needed to guard against terrorist attacks. Gregory wrote that the order uses â€œvague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.â€?Trump during the presidential campaign called for a â€œtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1
0091,McMaster says 'of course' Trump supports NATO Article 5,"TAORMINA, Italy (Reuters) - U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Saturday that â€œof courseâ€?President Donald Trump backed NATOâ€™s mutual defense doctrine, despite not making an explicit reference to it during a visit to Brussels this week. Speaking at NATO headquarters earlier this week, Trump disappointed allies by not mentioning his support for Article 5, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is viewed as an attack on all. During his election campaign, Trump appeared to called Article 5 into question by suggesting that NATO members who did not pay their fair share for the alliance may not deserve to benefit from it. â€œI think itâ€™s extraordinary that there would be an expectation that the president would have to say explicitly that he supports Article 5. Of course he does,â€?McMaster told reporters at the end of a Group of Seven summit in Sicily. â€œHe did not make a decision not to say it,â€?McMaster continued. â€œIt was implicit in the speech. There was no decision to not put it in there. It is a matter of fact that the United States, the president, stands firmly behind our Article 5 commitments under NATO.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/27,1
0092,Texas governor draws criticism for joke about shooting journalists,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott joked about shooting journalists while visiting a gun range on Friday to sign a bill lowering the cost of a handgun license, drawing criticism from gun-safety and free-press advocates who called his remarks â€œdangerous.â€?Abbott signed the bill at an indoor gun range in Austin, the state capital, then demonstrated his own shooting skills at an upstairs firing gallery before holding up his bullet-pocked target and quipping, â€œIâ€™m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.â€?A photo of the moment, published by the Texas Tribune, showed the grinning first-term Republican governor pointing to the center of the paper target, where three rounds had pierced the bullâ€™s eye circle.  His comment drew sharp rebukes from Reporters Without Borders, headquartered in Paris, and the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Both said the incident was especially troubling as it came amid increasingly hostile rhetoric directed against the news media by Republican President Donald Trump and his supporters. â€œThis joke was dangerous and out of line. Because itâ€™s never just a joke to some,â€?Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a statement. â€œWords matter. In a state and country where dangerous people can still so easily buy guns without a background check, leaders of every political stripe should be careful not to green light violence on their behalf.â€?The two groups also cited the misdemeanor assault charge filed on Wednesday against Republican Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana, accused of body-slamming a reporter who asked him about healthcare on the eve of his election. â€œPoliticians must condemn this dangerous rhetoric against reporters as it can quickly escalate to physical violence like we saw in Montana,â€?Reporters Without Borders said in a Tweet. The groupâ€™s latest annual World Press Freedom Index of 180 countries ranks the United States at No. 43, one rung below the tiny West African nation of Burkino Faso. â€œWeâ€™re really seeing just how much America deserves that ranking right now,â€?said Margaux Ewen, the organizationâ€™s U.S. advocacy director. Abbottâ€™s office did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment. The bill he signed will cut fees for a first-time license to carry a handgun from $140 to $40, and lower the renewal fee from $70 to $40, starting in September. It also waives the fees for peace officers and members of the military. â€œNo law-abiding Texan should be priced out of the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights,â€?Abbott said in signing the measure.

0093,Russian with ties to former Trump aide wants immunity for testimony: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian oligarch once close to Paul Manafort, President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, has offered to testify to congressional panels investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but lawmakers are rejecting his conditions, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing congressional officials. The offer by aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska comes amid growing attention to his ties to Manafort, one of several Trump associates under scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign. Manafort and Deripaska did business in the mid-2000s, when Manafort, a Republican operative, was providing campaign advice to Ukrainian politicians backed by Moscow, but their relationship later deteriorated, resulting in a lawsuit, the Times said.  Representatives for Deripaska in the United States did not respond to the Timesâ€?requests for comment. Manafort has denied any impropriety with his ties to Russia and has turned over documents a Senate intelligence panel had requested.         Deripaska, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, recently offered to cooperate with congressional intelligence committees in exchange for full immunity,Â accordingÂ to three congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, the Times said. However, the Senate and House panels rejected his offer because of concerns that immunity agreements create complications for federal criminal investigators, the officialsÂ said, according to the Times. The congressional investigations into Russian interference in the election is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the Justice Department, former FBI Director Robert Mueller.     Trumpâ€™s administration has been dogged by concerns about its ties to Russia and questions over whether Trump associates may have cooperated with Russians as they sought to meddle in last yearâ€™s election on Trumpâ€™s behalf. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Controversy has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9 as Comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia.

0094,White House agrees to detail ethics waivers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will comply with a request from the U.S. governmentâ€™s ethics agency to provide information on which former lobbyists are working in the administration, an administration official said on Friday. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said in a letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by the Office of Government Ethics to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). â€œOMB shares the belief that the executive branch must uphold the highest ethical standards in accordance with the law,â€?Mulvaney wrote. â€œOur concern was, and is, protecting the process related to the data call.â€?Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the administration of President Donald Trump granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request â€œhighly unusualâ€?and said his agency has the authority to take â€œcorrective action proceedingsâ€?against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to â€œensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions.â€?â€œOMB has never sought to impede OGE,â€?he wrote. Mulvaney closed the letter by saying the OMB did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work. But the administration has the power to grant waivers to particular hires, exempting them from that restriction. ",politicsNews,2017/5/27,1
0095,Senate intelligence panel requests Trump campaign documents: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Intelligence Committee, investigating Russian meddling in U.S. 2016 election, has asked President Donald Trumpâ€™s political organization to hand over all documents going back the campaignâ€™s launch in June 2015, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing two people briefed on the request.  The letter from the Senate panel seeking all documents, emails and telephone records arrived at Trumpâ€™s campaign committee last week and was addressed to its treasurer, the Post said. This marked the first time the Trump campaign organization has been drawn into the bipartisan committeeâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, it said. Dozens of former campaign staffers are expected to be contacted soon to ensure they are aware of the request, the Post said, citing the two people. The letter was signed by Republican Senator Richard Burr, the committeeâ€™s chairman, and Senator Mark Warner, its top Democrat, according to the Post, which said representatives for Burr and Warner declined to comment. The Senate panelâ€™s investigation is among several in Congress into Russian interference in the election, and is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the Justice Department, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. Trumpâ€™s campaign committee, based at Trump Tower in New York, is now led by Michael Glassner, a former deputy campaign manager, and John Pence, a nephew of Vice President Mike Pence, the Post said. Glassner did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a White House representative had no immediate comment, the Post said.

0096,Trump's bid to open U.S. monuments to development draws calls for protection,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s call for an opening of U.S. national monuments to economic development has drawn 107,00 comments from the public, with many expressing hope that sites like Utahâ€™s Bears Ears can maintain their protected status. President Donald Trump last month ordered the Interior Department to review some 27 national monuments created since 1996, with an eye to rescinding or shrinking the size of some of them to increase development opportunities. â€œIt would be a travesty to leave this landscape vulnerable to uranium and fossil-fuel mining, and excessive off-road vehicle use,â€?the Navajo-led Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition wrote in one public comment. The five-tribe group oversees the Bears Ears monument and lobbied hard to secure its monument designation by former President Barack Obama in December. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke gave the public until May 26 to comment on Bears Ears, the countryâ€™s newest monument, and until July 10 to comment on the rest. As of Friday, groups and individuals had posted more than 107,000 comments on a government website created to receive them as part of the review process, a high number given the short time frame.  A Commerce Department call for public comments on regulatory hurdles completed last month drew under 200 comments. One public comment, made anonymously, urged Zinke not to bow to industry and political pressure to alter the Bears Ears monument. â€œDo the hard thing, speak for the many and not the few,â€?it said. Many industry groups and politicians, including Utahâ€™s governor, two senators and congressman, want Zinke to reverse monument designations and turn over control of the protected lands to states.  Zinke is due to give his recommendation to Trump on Bears Ears on June 10 and publish a report on the other monuments later. Conservation groups said support of national monuments is wider than the online comments suggest. â€œThis issue just strikes a nerve with people,â€?said Randi Spivak of the Center for Biological Diversity. But many opponents of the monument designations have posted comments, with some arguing that barring large swaths of land from any development keeps the public from fully enjoying these areas. â€œSweeping monument designations ... restrict or eliminate opportunities for responsible off-highway motorized recreation on public lands,â€?said one anonymous comment, from a self-described member of the American Motorcycle Association.

0097,"In shakeup, Trump to set up 'war room' to repel attacks over Russia probe","BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Once U.S. President Donald Trump returns from his overseas trip, the White House plans to launch its most aggressive effort yet to push back against allegations involving Russia and his presidential campaign, tackling head-on a scandal that has threatened to consume his young presidency. Trumpâ€™s advisers are planning to establish a â€œwar roomâ€?to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his presidential campaign before and after Novemberâ€™s presidential election, while bringing new aides into the White House, administration officials and persons close to Trump told Reuters. The strategic shake-up comes as Republicans in Washington increasingly have fretted that the probe, continued chaos in the West Wing and Trumpâ€™s steady slide in opinion polls will derail the presidentâ€™s drive to reform healthcare, cut taxes and rebuild the nationâ€™s infrastructure. Upon Trumpâ€™s return, the administration will add experienced political professionals, including Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, and possibly more lawyers to handle the Russia probe, which has gained new urgency since the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation, the sources said. Beyond pushing back at suggestions that Moscow is unduly influencing Trumpâ€™s administration, the messaging effort will also focus on advancing Trumpâ€™s stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of Washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of Trumpâ€™s campaign. A person in regular touch with the White House said it needed a different structure to focus on the â€œnew realityâ€?that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities, leaks that have increased in frequency since Trump fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey on May 9. â€œSince the firing of Comey, that really exposed the fact that the White House in its current structure ... is not prepared for really a one-front war, let alone a two-front war,â€?the person said. â€œThey need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focusedâ€?while â€œalso truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks.â€?The White House declined to comment on plans for a â€œwar roomâ€?but said Trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the presidentâ€™s trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe.Â A White House official confirmed plans to hold more rallies. Trump returns to Washington on Saturday from his first trip abroad as president. â€œThe president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the White House looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to D.C.,â€?said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation, as will Steve Bannon, another top adviser who specializes in managing Trumpâ€™s populist appeal and shaping his political image, the sources said. Bannon and Trumpâ€™s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week, they added. On Thursday, NBC News and the Washington Post reported that Kushner, who held several meetings with Russian officials following the election, is a focus of the probe, making him the first current White House official to be caught up in it, although Kushner, who is Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Corey Lewandowski, Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, is also expected to be part of the effort. Lewandowski, who has been seen in the White House recently, could join the administration as early as next week, a source close to him said. Lewandowski was fired by Trump in June 2016 over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against Democrat Hillary Clinton, but has remained a trusted adviser to Trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs. This month, the Justice Department named Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as an independent special counsel in the probe. Trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasnâ€™t done a more effective job at making the case that he isnâ€™t implicated in the Russia probe and highlighting his administrationâ€™s successes, sources close to the president said. The White House declined to comment on the presidentâ€™s frustrations. Another Republican close to the White House said the new team is taking a page out of former President Bill Clintonâ€™s playbook. When Clinton faced impeachment in the late 1990s, he assembled a crisis-management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with Monica Lewinsky while allowing the rest of the White House to deal with day-to-day policy matters.  â€œThe goal of the White House is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel,â€?the Republican said. Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump friend, said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the White House to focus on issues that pump up his base voters. â€œFrom my perspective, I think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best, which is talking about his agenda: jobs, trade and security,â€?Ruddy said.  Trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The White House said other similar events are in the planning stages. Republicans in Congress are aching for Trump to leave the distraction of the Russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration.  â€œWhat we really want to be able to do is tend to our business,â€?Mike Rounds, a Republican Senator from South Dakota, told Reuters. â€œWeâ€™ve got a healthcare bill weâ€™re working on. Weâ€™ve got tax reform that we think is important.â€?Some of Trumpâ€™s donors, too, say they are concerned. Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire radio mogul from Minnesota, said he worries that the White House continues to be distracted by the Russia scandal, but laid some of the blame on Trump himself.  â€œHe talks when he shouldnâ€™t,â€?he said. Former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said this week that Trumpâ€™s time in office has been a â€œcomplete disasterâ€?aside from foreign affairs.

The former Ohio congressman said he has been friends with Trump for 15 years but never thought he would occupy the White House.  And while he praised Trumpâ€™s aggressive steps to challenge the Islamic State militant group and other moves in international affairs, he was highly critical of the presidentâ€™s other early efforts. â€œEverything else heâ€™s done has been a complete disaster,â€?Boehner said at the energy conference in Houston on Wednesday, according to the energy publication Rigzone. â€œHeâ€™s still learning how to be president.â€?A spokesman for Boehner confirmed the comments. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Boehnerâ€™s remarks. The former House speaker, who resigned from Congress in 2015, was also highly critical of efforts by the administration and his former Republican colleagues in Congress to advance sweeping healthcare and tax reform plans. He said Republicans should never have tried to â€œrepeal and replaceâ€?the Affordable Care Act, even after the House narrowly passed an overhaul measure. The Senate is considering its own version of the package. And he dismissed tax reform efforts, which form a cornerstone of the Republican policy agenda, as â€œjust a bunch of happy talk.â€?While Boehnerâ€™s successor, Speaker Paul Ryan, tries to include a border adjustment tax, a tax on imports, as a key piece of any tax code overhaul, Boehner declared it â€œdeader than a doornailâ€?amid opposition from fellow Republicans and the White House.

However, he described any calls to impeach Trump as the purview of â€œthe crazy left-wing Democratic colleagues of mine.â€?Democratic Representative Al Green has formally introduced articles of impeachment for Trump, but such an effort has not been embraced by most Democratic lawmakers as the investigation continues.

0099,"Before the White House, Kennedy was a high-school prankster","BOSTON (Reuters) - Years before he captained the torpedo boat PT-109, ran for office or set the United States on a path to put a man on the moon, President John F. Kennedy was a troublesome teen whose hijinks nearly got him kicked out of his prestigious boarding school. The scion of a wealthy Boston family, Kennedy spent his mid-teens at Connecticutâ€™s elite Choate Rosemary Hall, where he excelled at history and literature - but infuriated the schoolâ€™s headmaster by organizing pranks as a member of an unofficial school club known as â€œThe Muckers.â€?Those details of the early life of the 35th president, whose term was cut short by an assassinâ€™s bullet in Dallas in 1963, emerge in a new exhibit at Bostonâ€™s John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, timed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth on May 29, 1917. Pages from a high school scrapbook, diligently filled out by the man who would go on to become the first Roman Catholic president, show he loved ancient history, music and football, as well as â€œbeefing,â€?slang for complaining or arguing. Despite his later fame as an orator, he never got higher than the middling grade of C+ in public speaking, according to the school. â€œGot shot at today for calling an old farmer a bad name,â€?reads an entry written by a 17-year-old Kennedy on Oct. 19, 1934. â€œAlmost got hit.â€?The scrapbook pages are among 40 Kennedy relics never before publicly exhibited, with notes extending to his years at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, before his World War Two service aboard torpedo boats and well before his first successful run for Congress in 1947. Kennedy went on the serve in the Senate before being elected president in 1960, at the start of one of the most tumultuous decades in U.S. history. â€œThatâ€™s why I so love this scrapbook, because it is so revealing about who he was at the time,â€?said Stacey Bredhoff, the museumâ€™s curator. Kennedy and his prankster friends went head-to-head with Choateâ€™s headmaster, George St. John, in his years at the school. The â€œMuckersâ€?club took its name from a speech in which St. John excoriated pranksters, using the label applied to Irish immigrants whose only work was shoveling up horse manure. The group took the idea and ran with it, commissioning gold shovel pins and hatching a plot to pile horse manure in the school gymnasium. â€œGeorge St. John got wind of it and even though the prank never was actualized, it was enough that they would even consider such a thing, so he threatened to expel them all,â€?but eventually relented, said Judy Donald, the schoolâ€™s archivist. The details of the groupâ€™s successful pranks may be lost to time. But Donald said an oft-told tale that a young Kennedy blew up a school toilet with a powerful firecracker known as a cherry bomb is not true - while that incident did occur, it was the work of another student a decade later. â€œSt. John was understandably angry,â€?Donald said. â€œBut JFK was not responsible for that one.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1

But she took several veiled swipes at the businessman-turned-politician, whose budget proposal earlier this week proposed sharp cuts in programs for healthcare and food assistance. â€œLook at the budget that was just proposed in Washington. It is an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us,â€?Clinton told a crowd at the all-womenâ€™s college, located in Bostonâ€™s suburbs. â€œIt grossly underfunds public education, mental health and even efforts to combat the opioid epidemic.â€?White House officials have described the proposed budget as providing tax cuts that they say would stimulate economic growth and create more private-sector jobs. As with all presidential budget proposals, the proposal was more of a wishlist that is unlikely to be approved in its current form by Congress. Clinton, a former secretary of state, warned against an erosion of accepted standards of truth in U.S. public discourse, and also appeared to be attacking Trump on this issue. â€œYou are graduating a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason. Just log on to social media for 10 seconds, it will hit you right in the face,â€?she said, citing hoax online reports that her campaign was tied to a Washington pizzeria that operated a child sex ring.     â€œWhen people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,â€?Clinton said. â€œThis is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done.â€?She also urged graduates of the liberal-leaning school, which is located in one of the most Democratic states in the country, not to retreat into their own partisan echo chambers, saying, â€œyour learning, listening and serving should include people who donâ€™t agree with you politically.â€?Clinton has had a long public career since graduating in 1969 from Wellesley. She was first lady during her husband Bill Clintonâ€™s two terms in the White House and was later elected to the U.S. Senate representing New York state. She made an unsuccessful presidential run in 2008 before serving as the countryâ€™s top diplomat during President Barack Obamaâ€™s first term. Clinton, 69, has gradually returned to the public eye since her upset November defeat, saying that she will not run for office again but will serve as an activist citizen. ",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1
0101,Republican wins Montana special election despite assault charge,"BOZEMAN, Mont. (Reuters) - Republican Greg Gianforte defeated a political novice to win Montanaâ€™s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, barely 24 hours after he was charged with assaulting a reporter who asked him about the Republican healthcare bill. A race that was expected to be a test of President Donald Trumpâ€™s political influence ahead of next yearâ€™s U.S. congressional elections was jolted by the charge against Gianforte, a wealthy technology executive who had urged voters to send him to Congress to help Trump. Speaking to cheering supporters in Bozeman after his win, Gianforte apologized for the incident and said he was not proud of his actions. â€œI should not have responded the way I did, and for that Iâ€™m sorry,â€?Gianforte said. â€œI should not have treated that reporter that way.â€?Gianforte beat Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo player and first-time candidate who had focused his campaign on criticism of the Republican effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamaâ€™s healthcare law. CNN projected Gianforte would win. With 96 percent of the vote counted, he led Quist by 51 percent to 43 percent. Gianforte prevailed despite being charged on Wednesday night with misdemeanor assault on Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, who said the candidate â€œbody-slammedâ€?him during a campaign event in Bozeman. Gianforteâ€™s victory is a boost for Republicans, who are worried Trumpâ€™s political stumbles and the unpopularity of the healthcare bill passed by the House will hurt their chances of holding on to a 24-seat House majority in next yearâ€™s elections. But the relatively close margin of the race in Republican-leaning Montana was encouraging to Democrats, who are already focused on next monthâ€™s hotly contested special House election in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. Gianforte had been favored to win in Montana, where Republicans have held the lone House seat for two decades and where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. The race had grown closer in the last week, however, as Quist focused on criticism of the House healthcare bill.  Quist, wearing his signature cowboy hat, told supporters in Missoula, Montana, that the grassroots energy of his campaign would continue. â€œI know that Montanans will hold Mr Gianforte accountable,â€?Quist said. It was unclear if Gianforteâ€™s assault had an impact on the vote. More than a third of the stateâ€™s registered voters had already submitted ballots before it happened, state election officials said, and some Gianforte supporters shrugged off the charges or said they did not believe published accounts. â€œI feel like, itâ€™s all just propaganda, you know what I mean, itâ€™s hard for me to believe anything the media tells me,â€?said Nathaniel Trumper, who cast a vote for Gianforte at a polling station in Helena. The assault occurred as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who was preparing to interview Gianforte, said the candidate â€œgrabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground.â€?Afterward, three state newspapers rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte. Some Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, suggested he apologize. Gianforte specifically addressed his apology to Jacobs. â€œLast night I made a mistake,â€?he said, adding: â€œIâ€™m sorry, Mr Ben Jacobs.â€?Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Gianforteâ€™s apology â€œa good first step toward redemptionâ€?and said she hoped he â€œcontinues to work toward righting his wrong.â€?Gianforte will take the House seat vacated when Trump named Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence recorded robocalls to voters on Gianforteâ€™s behalf, and Republican groups poured millions into ads criticizing Quist for property tax liens and unpaid debts, which Quist said stemmed from a botched gallbladder surgery. Quist, who raised more than $6 million for his upstart bid, said the experience gave him insight into the economic struggles some people face. He campaigned last weekend with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the stateâ€™s 2016 Democratic presidential primary against Hillary Clinton. Gianforte could face additional, more serious charges once prosecutors review the evidence, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert told Reuters. Gianforte has two weeks to enter a plea to the misdemeanor citation issued by the Gallatin County Sheriffâ€™s Office, according to Lambert, who said he would likely review the case before then to decide whether it should be treated as a felony offense, which would supersede the current charge. â€œThereâ€™s always the possibility that when we get the case and the details, that we might look differently at the charging decision,â€?Lambert said.

0102,U.S. takes 'full responsibility' for Manchester intelligence leaks:  Tillerson,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States government takes full responsibility for leaks of the British police investigation into Mondayâ€™s deadly bomb attack in Manchester which killed 22 people, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday. Appearing alongside British foreign secretary Boris Johnson in London, Tillerson said that â€œall across America, hearts are brokenâ€?at news of the attack on people attending a concert by U.S. pop singer Ariana Grande. British police briefly suspended intelligence sharing with the United States on Thursday after private details of their investigation repeatedly appeared in American media. â€œWe take full responsibility for that and we obviously regret that that happened,â€?Tillerson said. â€œWith respect to the release of information inappropriately ... certainly we condemn that.â€?

0103,Trump son-in-law Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia probe: media reports," (Corrects Comey firing to May 9 in fifth paragraph.) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser, is under scrutiny by the FBI in the Russia probe, the Washington Post and NBC News reported on Thursday. Kushner is being investigated because of his meetings in December and other possible interactions with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow, the Post reported, citing people familiar with the investigation. Kushner is the only current White House official known to be considered a key person in the probe, the newspaper reported. The FBI, several congressional committees and a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department are looking into allegations of meddling by Russia in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russian officials seeking to influence the election. The controversy has engulfed Trumpâ€™s administration since he fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies collusion with Russia.     The interest in Kushner does not mean investigators suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him, the officials told NBC News. It is not known whether Kushner has received any requests from the FBI for records, NBC News said. One of Kushnerâ€™s attorneys, Jamie Gorelick, said in a  statement her client would cooperate with the investigation. â€œMr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry,â€?Gorelick said. The FBI and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

0104,"In blow to Trump, U.S. appeals court refuses to reinstate travel ban","(Reuters) - In a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, a U.S. appeals court refused on Thursday to reinstate his travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court.  The decision, written by Chief Judge Roger Gregory, described Trumpâ€™s executive order in forceful terms, saying it uses â€œvague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.â€? Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the government, which says the temporary travel ban is needed to guard against terrorist attacks, would seek a review of the case at the Supreme Court.  â€œThese clearly are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,â€?said Michael Short, a White House spokesman.  MORE FROM REUTERSÂ Â *Â Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia probe: media reportsÂ *Â Ireland looks set to elect gay premier in social, generational shiftÂ *Â EXCLUSIVE: Kim Jong Un's 'rocket stars' He added that the White House was confident the order would ultimately be upheld by the judiciary.  In its 10-3 ruling, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said those challenging the ban, including refugee groups and individuals, were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violates the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s bar against favoring one religion over another.  Gregory cited statements by Trump during the 2016 presidential election calling for a Muslim ban. During the race, Trump called for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslimâ€™s entering the United Statesâ€?in a statement on his website.  The judge wrote that a reasonable observer would likely conclude the orderâ€™s â€œprimary purpose is to exclude persons from the United States on the basis of their religious beliefs.â€? The government had argued that the court should not take into account Trumpâ€™s comments on the campaign trail since they occurred before he took office on Jan. 20. But the appeals court rejected that view, saying they provide a window into the motivations for Trumpâ€™s action in government.  The appeals court questioned a government argument that the president has wide authority to halt the entry of people to the United States.  â€œCongress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,â€?the majority opinion said.  The Virginia-based appeals court was reviewing a March ruling by Maryland-based federal judge Theodore Chuang that blocked part of Trumpâ€™s March 6 executive order barring people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government put in place stricter visa screening.  A similar ruling against Trumpâ€™s policy from a Hawaii-based federal judge is still in place. That ruling went farther than Chuangâ€™s order, blocking a section of the travel ban that also suspended refugee admissions for four months. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is still reviewing that decision.  Trump has lashed out at the judges and courts that have ruled against him, saying the 9th Circuit has a â€œterribleâ€?record and calling its rulings on his policies â€œridiculous.â€? The March ban was Trumpâ€™s second effort to implement travel restrictions through an executive order. The first, issued on Jan. 27, led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts.  The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but it was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.  In an opinion that concurred with the majority on Thursday, Judge Stephanie Thacker wrote that the administration did nothing to distance itself from the first order, describing the revised ban as â€œthe proverbial wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing.â€? Chief Judge Gregory, who wrote the majority opinion, was first installed in a recess appointment by Democratic President Bill Clinton and then nominated to the same post by Republican former president George W. Bush.  Nine other judges appointed by Democrats agreed to block the travel ban, while three Republican-appointed judges dissented.  â€œThis to us is a complete win and overwhelming in terms of the votes,â€?said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrantsâ€?Rights Project, who argued the case in the 4th Circuit.  The dissenting judges said the executive order was constitutional and a valid exercise of presidential authority, and that Trumpâ€™s campaign statements should not have come into play. The order itself â€œcontains no reference to religion whatsoever,â€?Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote.  The White House also pointed to a dissent by Judge Dennis Shedd that said â€œthe real losers in this case are the millions of individual Americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm.â€? Two other 4th Circuit judges, both appointed by Republicans, were recused from the case.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0105,U.S. visas issued to citizens of Trump travel ban nations continue to decline,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States issued about 50 percent fewer visitor visas in April to citizens of seven countries covered by President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year, according to a Reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on Thursday. The total number of U.S. non-immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was about 15 percent lower in April compared with the 2016 monthly average. The April data shows the continuation of a trend identified in data for the month of March, which the State Department released last month. That data showed that citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries under the bans - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - received about 40 percent fewer visitor visas in March than in an average month last year.  [nL1N1HZ2PJ] Trumpâ€™s travel bans have been blocked by the courts. Citizens of the seven countries received about 2,800 non-immigrant visas in April 2017, compared with about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. Data from previous years is only available in aggregate by fiscal year, rather than month-by-month. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8EFbm) The State Department released the data to comply with a directive from Trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world. The agency did not release data on the number of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of visas is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times. â€œVisa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level,â€?said William Cocks, a spokesman for the State Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Consular Affairs. Trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make Americans safer from attacks, signed an executive order on Jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days. After the order was blocked by federal courts, the Trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower ban which dropped Iraq from the list. Courts have also halted parts of the second order. On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate the travel ban, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. [nL1N1IR1FY] Although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries compared with last yearsâ€?averages, Iraqis in April received 349 immigrant visas, which are typically given to those with jobs or family members in the United States, compared with 305 in an average month in 2016. Syrians also received more immigrant visas in April - 268 versus an average of 219 per month last year. All other countries targeted by one of Trumpâ€™s bans received fewer immigrant visas in April than in an average month last year. ",politicsNews,2017/5/26,1
0106,"Trump directly scolds NATO allies, says they owe 'massive' sums","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday intensified his accusations that NATO allies were not spending enough on defense and warned of more attacks like this weekâ€™s Manchester bombing unless the alliance did more to stop militants. In unexpectedly abrupt remarks as NATO leaders stood alongside him, Trump said certain member countries owed â€œmassive amounts of moneyâ€?to the United States and NATO â€?even though allied contributions are voluntary, with multiple budgets. His scripted comments contrasted with NATOâ€™s choreographed efforts to play up the Westâ€™s unity by inviting Trump to unveil a memorial to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States at the new NATO headquarters building in Brussels. â€œTerrorism must be stopped in its tracks, or the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever,â€?Trump said, referring to Mondayâ€™s suicide bombing in the English city that killed 22 people, including children. â€œThese grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very, very direct ... in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share,â€?Trump said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg defended Trump, saying that although he was â€œbluntâ€?he had â€œa very plain and clear message on the expectationsâ€?of allies.  But one senior diplomat said Trump, who left the leadersâ€?dinner before it ended to fly to Italy for Fridayâ€™s Group of Seven summit, said the remarks did not go down well at all. â€œThis was not the right place or time,â€?the diplomat said of the very public harangue. â€œWe are left with nothing else but trying to put a brave face on it.â€? In another unexpected twist, Trump called on NATO, an organization founded on collective defense against the Soviet threat, to include limiting immigration in its tasks. And Trump did say that the United States â€œwill never forsake the friends who stood by our sideâ€?but NATO leaders had hoped he would more explicitly support the mutual defense rules of a  military allianceâ€™s he called â€œobsoleteâ€?during his campaign.  Instead, he returned to a grievance about Europeâ€™s drop in defense spending since the end of the Cold War and failed to publicly commit to NATOâ€™s founding Article V rule which stipulates that an attack on one ally is an attack against all. â€œTwenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying for their defense,â€?Trump said, standing by a piece of the wreckage of the Twin Towers. â€œThis is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years,â€?Trump said as the other leaders watched. Nicholas Burns, a former long-time diplomat and ambassador to NATO from 2001-2005, now a professor at Harvardâ€™s Kennedy School of Government, said every U.S. president since Harry Truman had pledged support for Article V and that the United States would defend Europe. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was â€?00 percentâ€?committed to collective defense.Â â€œWe are not playing cutesie with this. He is fully committed,â€?Spicer said. Praise was always going to be in short supply after Trumpâ€™s sharp election campaign criticism of the alliance, which he blamed for not doing more to combat terrorism. Last year, Trump threatened to abandon U.S. allies in Europe if they did not spend enough on defense, comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex-Soviet Baltic states on Russiaâ€™s border which fear Moscow might try a repeat of its 2014 annexation of Ukraineâ€™s Crimea. Although he has since softened his tone in phone calls and meetings with Western leaders, Trumpâ€™s sharp words on Thursday recalled his awkward meeting with Angela Merkel in March, when he pressed the German chancellor for Germany to meet NATOâ€™s military spending target. NATO diplomats planned to placate Trump with a pledge on Thursday to agree to national plans by the end of this year showing how NATO allies will meet a promise to spend 2 percent of economic output every year on defense by 2024. But Trump increased the pressure, calling that agreement made at a summit in Wales in 2014 â€œthe bare minimumâ€? â€œEven 2 percent of GDP is insufficient ... 2 percent is the bare minimum for confronting todayâ€™s very real and very vicious threats,â€?Trump said. He also made his presence felt at his first NATO summit, literally, pushing his way past Montenegroâ€™s prime minister, Dusko Markovic, whose country joins the organization next month, in footage that went viral. Spicer said he had not seen the video but assumed the U.S. president was moving to his designated spot. NATO nonetheless strived to impress Trump with allied jets flying overhead and a walk through the new glass headquarters, which replaces a 1960s prefab structure. Trump, a real estate magnate, called the building â€œbeautifulâ€?and joked that he did not dare ask how much it cost. ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0107,U.S. lawmakers reintroduce bill to end restrictions on Cuba travel,"HAVANA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators reintroduced legislation on Thursday to repeal all restrictions on travel to Cuba, this time attracting far more co-sponsors in a sign of growing support for U.S.-Cuban detente even as its future looks uncertain. The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act was introduced in 2015 by eight Republican and Democratic co-sponsors but never made it to the floor. The latest measure attracted 55 co-sponsors. While efforts to ease the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba have been gathering strength and 55 votes would be a majority in the 100-member Senate, that number falls short of the 60 needed to advance the legislation. There was no indication the chamberâ€™s Republican leaders would allow the measure to come up for a vote. Republican President Donald Trump threatened during his 2016 election campaign to reverse a normalization of ties with the Communist-run, Caribbean island initiated in 2014 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Trumpâ€™s administration is reviewing U.S. policy toward the countryâ€™s former Cold War foe. Obama eased trade and travel restrictions, fueling a boom in American visits to Cuba, although tourism was still not officially allowed. On Wednesday, more than 40 U.S. travel companies and organizations urged Trump not to roll back expanded U.S. travel to Cuba.  â€œIt is Americans who are penalized by our travel ban, not the Cuban government,â€Â said U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy led the group that co-sponsored the bill. Flake added that lifting the ban would give Americans more freedom but also benefit the Cuban people. â€œThis is certain to have positive benefits for the islandâ€™s burgeoning entrepreneurial and private sector.â€?The number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, boosting business for Cuban hotels, BnBs, restaurants and taxis but also U.S. cruise operators and airlines that entered the market over the past year. â€œWe applaud Senators Flake and Leahy for their leadership in supporting the American and Cuban people by eliminating archaic, outdated policy,â€?said James Williams, president of the Washington-based Engage Cuba group.  There is still strong congressional opposition to any ending of Cubaâ€™s isolation, led by anti-Castro Cuban-American lawmakers including Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez. They say the United States should not make travel to Cuba easier before the Havana government moves toward democracy. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0108,Trump officials under fire over vague tax proposals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Missing from President Donald Trumpâ€™s budget proposal this week was an annual report, known as the Green Book, that presidents have issued for many years to spell out their tax goals in detail, an omission that tax experts called telling. The Green Book, named for the color of its cover in recent years, is not that big a deal as a document, but its absence this year shows that the Trump White House lacks a clear vision for what to do about overhauling the tax code, experts said. â€œI think itâ€™s as simple as no tax plan equals no Green Book,â€?said Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday in two Senate hearings criticized the presidentâ€™s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on Tuesday, and some of its core tax components. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen called the budget proposal and its tax assumptions â€œfantasy flim-flam.â€?Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing at one of the hearings, said the budget proposal did not consider how new tax laws would impact government revenues and the deficit because the Trump administration did not have a detailed tax proposal. â€œWhen the presidentâ€™s budget was done, we were not ready to have a full-blown tax reform plan,â€?Mnuchin said, adding that tax details would be worked out with Congress, then made public. A Treasury Department official said separately it would not help to publish details while talks with Congress were underway. â€œReleasing a Green Book of tax policy proposals as we work towards comprehensive tax reform would contradict that effort,â€?the Treasury official said in an email. The last Green Book was issued by the Obama administration in February 2016 and ran 283 pages. Past Green Books going back to 1990 are available on the Treasury Department website. As a candidate, Trump, in his 125th day in power, promised voters that he would work with Congress and seek passage in his first 100 days of â€œmassive tax reduction and simplification.â€?He has not yet offered any tax legislation. On April 26, the administration released a one-page list of tax proposals summarized in 12 bullet points. Tuesdayâ€™s budget repeated the one-page summary, including a proposal to end the estate tax on inheritances paid by a few wealthy Americans. Despite this policy position, the Trump budget included a projection of $328 billion in estate tax revenues for 2018-2027. â€œIâ€™ve seen lots of tricky budgets before, but this may take the cake,â€?said Democratic Senator Mark Warner. â€œYou assume abolishment of the so-called death tax, estate tax, but ... you still count the revenues from the estate and gift tax, which is kind of a tricky thing. I would call that double-counting.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0109,Civil rights group sues in U.S. court over immigration detention,"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in federal court on Thursday, seeking records the civil rights group contends provide accounts of hunger strikes at immigration detention facilities. The ACLU said in its filing that in recent weeks there have been a new series of hunger strikes at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers in Georgia, Oregon and Washington, adding hunger strikes have previously hit detention centers in Arizona, Florida, Louisiana and Texas. The suit comes as U.S. Republican President Donald Trump has promised a crackdown on illegal immigration and the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress this month agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for those suspected of illegally entering the country. â€œThe Trump administrationâ€™s plans to expand detention and strip away existing structures for oversight of detention are likely to produce more protests both inside and outside the walls of detention facilities,â€?the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in an email: â€œICE is unable to comment on pending litigation.â€?The lawsuit said detention center inmates have launched the hunger strikes over the past few years as a non-violent way to bring attention to what they see as a lack of access to bond hearings and inhumane conditions of confinement. The suit also said that some inmates who have previously launched hunger strikes were met with extraordinarily punitive responses. From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the presidentâ€™s goal of â€œenhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending â€˜catch and releaseâ€?for those apprehended at the border.â€?The agreement reached in Congress would increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. In April, hundreds of detainees at an immigration detention center in Washington state began refusing meals in a hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility and delayed immigration hearings, activists said. The Geo Group Inc, the company that operates the Washington state facility and other detention centers around the United States, declined to comment on the lawsuit. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0110,U.S. lawmakers to fight massive Trump Saudi arms deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Thursday seeking to stop at least a portion of President Donald Trumpâ€™s sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Chris Murphy and Al Franken introduced a resolution of disapproval in the Senate to force a vote on whether to block part of the sale. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee received formal notice of the pending sale on May 19. The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 allows a senator to force a vote on an arms sale, once Congress is formally notified of plans to go ahead. The same three senators introduced a similar resolution last year seeking to block the sale of $1.15 billion of tanks and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. That measure was defeated overwhelmingly. Saudi Arabia was the first stop on Trumpâ€™s first international trip this week, and he marked the visit by announcing the arms deal in Riyadh on May 20. Saudi Arabia agreed to by $110 billion of U.S. arms, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. The lawmakers aim to block about $500 million of the sale, the portion including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons. â€œGiven Saudi Arabiaâ€™s past support of terror, poor human rights record, and questionable tactics in its war in Yemen, Congress must carefully consider and thoroughly debate if selling them billions of dollars of arms is in our best national security interest at this time,â€?Paul said in a statement. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives also took action on the planned sale on Thursday. Republican Representative Ted Yoho and Democrat Ted Lieu wrote to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asking for a hearing to review the sale of precision-guided munitions to Riyadh. Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen and civilian casualties. But Trump has said he wants to encourage international weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1

The FBI said it was still evaluating the request, which had a committee-set deadline of Wednesday, in light of the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the possibility of collusion between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russian officials seeking to influence the 2016 election, according to a letter released by committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz. In a responding letter, Chaffetz said he still wanted any related documents that would be outside the scope of the special counselâ€™s investigation, and a list of documents found to be within the scope of the probe, by June 8. â€œI am seeking to better understand Comeyâ€™s communications with the White House and Attorney General in such a way that does not implicate the Special Counselâ€™s work,â€?Chaffetz said in the letter. Chaffetz made his initial request for documents after a New York Times report that Comey had written in a memo that Trump asked him to halt an FBI investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian officials.   Chaffetzâ€™s panel is one of several in Congress investigating alleged efforts by Russia to tip the election to Trump, and the possibility that Trump associates had coordinated with Moscow. Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee made it easier on Wednesday for that panel to obtain documents for its investigation. Its chairman, Republican Richard Burr, told reporters that members had agreed unanimously to allow him and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, to issue subpoenas as they see fit, without a vote by the committee. The controversy has engulfed Trumpâ€™s administration since he fired Comey on May 10. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion.     The FBI letterâ€™s to Chaffetz on Thursday noted the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller last week as special counsel to investigate the issue. â€œIn light of this development and other considerations, we are undertaking appropriate consultation to ensure all relevant interests implicated by your request are properly evaluated,â€?the letter said.

0113,Lieberman withdraws from consideration to be FBI director,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman has withdrawn from consideration to be the next director of the FBI, citing the potential for an appearance of a conflict of interest given President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to retain an attorney who works at the same firm. Lieberman works at a New York firm headed by Marc Kasowitz, who has been hired by Trump to represent him amid probes by the Justice Department and Congress into possible ties between Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. â€œWith your selection of Marc Kasowitz to represent you in the various investigations that have begun, I do believe it would be best to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest,â€?Lieberman wrote to Trump in a letter dated Wednesday. A copy of the letter, which was first disclosed by the Wall Street Journal, was provided to Reuters on Thursday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Liebermanâ€™s withdrawal. Trump told reporters a week ago that he was â€œvery closeâ€?to selecting a nominee to replace James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and he said Lieberman was a leading candidate.  Trump fired Comey on May 9, a decision that set off a political firestorm given Comeyâ€™s central role in the FBIâ€™s probe of Russian meddling in the election and potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials seeking to swing the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. The Department of Justice appointed a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to lead an independent investigation into the Russia matter. Given Kasowitzâ€™s role, Lieberman might not have been able to participate in the Russia investigation for a period of two years without White House and Justice Department waivers, Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law told Reuters on Wednesday. A federal regulation restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firmâ€™s clients for one year, a period that was extended to two years under an executive order signed by Trump in January. CNN, citing a unnamed senior administration official, reported on Wednesday that Trump wanted to renew the search for an FBI director after having interviewed a number of candidates, including Lieberman. On Thursday, citing unnamed sources, CNN said John Pistole, a former deputy director at the FBI and a former head of the Transportation Security Administration, was under consideration.

0114,FBI director search: back to drawing board for Trump team?," (This version of the May 24 story corrects paragraph 9 to add reference to White House waiver) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week after President Donald Trump said he was close to picking a new FBI director to replace the one he fired, the White House has decided to renew its search, CNN reported on Wednesday. The Republican president said last Thursday he was â€œvery closeâ€?to selecting a new head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to replace James Comey, and that former Senator Joseph Lieberman was among the top candidates. Trump left the following day on his first trip abroad as president, a nine-day visit to the Middle East and Europe, without naming a replacement.  Citing an unidentified senior administration official, CNN said Trump now wants to consider additional candidates for the job. The White House and Lieberman did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which has played a lead role in the search, said it had no further information. Trump fired Comey on May 9 in a surprise announcement that sparked days of political turmoil. Comey was leading the FBIâ€™s probe of possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russian operatives whom U.S. intelligence officials say meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump and Russia deny any collusion. Lieberman is a senior counsel at the New York-based law firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, which has represented Trump on various matters for years.  Trump has tapped one of the firmâ€™s partners, Marc Kasowitz, to be his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his presidential campaign worked with Russia to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. If Trump were to nominate Lieberman, Lieberman might not have been able to participate in the Russia investigation for a period of two years without White House and Justice Department waivers, according to Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law. A federal regulation restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firmâ€™s clients for one year. This cooling-off period was extended to two years by an executive order Trump signed in January. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last Wednesday that Trump was scheduled to interview four candidates for the position before departing on his trip: Lieberman; acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating; and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.

0115,U.S. bill would ban American tourist travel to North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. congressmen introduced a bill on Thursday that would ban Americans from traveling to North Korea as tourists and require them to obtain special permission for other types of visits. Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Joe Wilson said their proposed North Korea Travel Control Act followed the detention of at least 17 Americans in North Korea in the past decade. North Korea has a record of using detained Americans to extract high-profile visits from the United States, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. â€œWith increased tensions in North Korea, the danger that Americans will be detained for political reasons is greater than ever,â€?the congressmen said in a statement. Given North Koreaâ€™s â€œdemonstrated willingness to use American visitors as bargaining chips to extract high level meetings or concessions, it is appropriate for the United States to take steps to control travel to a nation that poses a real and present danger to American interests,â€?they said. Four Americans are being held in North Korea as diplomatic tensions with Washington have heightened. Two of them, detained in the past month, are affiliated with a private university in the North Korean capital. A congressional source said the bill would ban tourist travel by Americans outright, while any other visits would require a special license from the Treasury Department, which is enforcing a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.      North Korea this month asserted its sovereign right to â€œruthlessly punishâ€?U.S. citizens it has detained for crimes against the government. It said calling such arrests bargaining ploys was â€œpure ignorance.â€?North Korea said on May 7 it had detained Kim Hake Song, who worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology,  on suspicion of â€œhostile acts.â€?Another American, Kim Sang Dok, who was associated with the same school, was detained in late April on the same charge. The other two Americans are Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old student detained in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years hard labor for attempting to steal a propaganda banner, and Kim Dong Chul, a 62-year-old Korean-American missionary. Kim was sentenced to 10 years hard labor for subversion last year. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0116,Trump shoves fellow NATO leader aside on his first summit,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump muscled himself to the front of the world stage in Brussels on Thursday, firmly pushing aside the leader of soon-to-be member Montenegro at a NATO summit. Footage showing the leaders caught Trump pushing his way past Prime Minister Dusko Markovic, then confidently adjusting his suit as he emerged in the front of the group, closer to NATO head Jens Stoltenberg. Video of the incident went viral and came as Trump delivered a tough message to NATO allies to dramatically increase their defense spending to ease financial burden to the United States. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked about Trump moving past Markovic, said he had not seen the video but assumed the U.S. president was moving to his designated spot. The NATO mission of Montenegro, which is joining the Western military alliance against stiff opposition from Russia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The small Balkan country will formally become NATOâ€™s 29th state in June but Markovic joined the Brussels summit, Trumpâ€™s first, and a ceremonial opening of the allianceâ€™s new headquarters. During the leadersâ€?joint photo shoot in the new building, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged his counterparts to wave for the cameras. Some did as Trudeau requested, but Trump did not raise his arm. Trump smiled briefly, but otherwise kept a serious expression on his face for the brief session.    ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1

0118,Congress ends effort to kill limits on debit card fees,"Washington (Reuters) - Banks were regrouping on Thursday, a day after being handed a large defeat in the U.S. House, where Republicans sided with retailers in agreeing to preserve limits on debit card fees. The financial industry insisted it was not done fighting to remove limits on the fees. Retailers were already looking to carry the fight to credit card fees. â€œWe are glad this fight is over, and are happy with our victory,â€?said Austen Jensen with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. â€œThe banks should clearly know that this is over with.â€?â€œThis debate is not over,â€?said Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. The House had been considering a broad financial reform bill that included a repeal of the Durbin amendment, which established the limits on debit card fees. The limits were backed by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois when the Dodd-Frank financial reform law was enacted in 2010. The effort to remove the card fee limits had drawn strong opposition in the House. Representative Jeb Hensarling, the billâ€™s author, announced Wednesday he would end the effort to eliminate the Durbin amendment because he did not want to see his entire finance bill upended. â€œIâ€™ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,â€?he said in a statement. â€œWe wonâ€™t let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill.â€?The full House is expected to vote on Hensarlingâ€™s bill in the coming weeks, but there is enough opposition in the Senate that it will probably not become law. The feud over government caps on the fees retailers pay when accepting debit cards has run red hot ever since the limits were imposed. With billions of dollars in revenue at stake, banks and retailers have battled nearly constantly in Washington. Retailers have argued the cap is critical to control sky-high costs imposed by a handful of card servicers, while banks insist the limit represents government meddling in private industry. Nichols said limiting debit card fees was â€œwrong and Congress should fix it.â€?Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve was ordered to set limits on how much Visa and Mastercard could charge for processing debit card transactions. The end result nearly halved fees received by banks, dropping the cost of a debit card transaction from an average of 45 cents to an average of 24 cents. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0119,"Trump talks trade with EU, varied differences remain","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A smiling Donald Trump offered European Union chiefs assurances on security in Brussels on Thursday but EU officials did not conceal lingering differences with the U.S. president over Russia, trade and climate change. â€œThe leaders discussed ... shared challenges in fighting global terrorism,â€?the White House said in a statement.  â€œThey agreed on the need to work together to deepen our security cooperation in fighting ISIS (Islamic State), combating radicalisation and responding to other common threats.â€?In talks before a summit of NATO leaders at the Atlantic military allianceâ€™s headquarters across town, an EU source said Trump had also voiced fears that Brexit could cost U.S. jobs â€?a possible sign of second thoughts on support for the British vote to leave which stunned the bloc.  And Trump also agreed to setting up a joint EU-U.S. â€œaction planâ€?on trade, in an indication the new occupant of the White House is not as set on shunning free trade deals and promoting protectionism as some in Europe had feared he might. The White House said â€œthe United States and the European Union should deepen our strong economic relationshipâ€?and spoke of a need to protect U.S. and EU industries from â€œunfair competitionâ€?â€?a shared concern coming, notably, from China. Nonetheless, European Council President Donald Tusk indicated, there was less than a meeting of minds on trade and other issues, despite the cordiality of Trumpâ€™s welcome. â€œWe agreed on many areas, first and foremost on counter-terrorism,â€?Tusk said after he and EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker met Trump for over an hour.  â€œBut some issues remain open, like climate and trade.â€?European leaders have been urging Trump not to abandon the U.S. commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions made when his predecessor Barack Obama signed up to the U.N. Paris accord. Tusk also said he did not feel he and Trump were on exactly the same page in terms of dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although they agreed on efforts to end conflict in Ukraine which the West blames on Moscow and which has resulted in both EU and U.S. economic sanctions on Russia. A spokeswoman for Juncker, the president of the European Commission which had been negotiating an ambitious free trade deal with Washington known as TTIP before Trumpâ€™s upset election victory, said the two sides would work to increase trade. â€œIntensifying trade cooperation ... is a win-win situation for both sides,â€?the EU spokeswoman said. â€œIt was agreed to start work on a joint action plan on trade.â€?Juncker declined comment on whether talks in the coming weeks might revive TTIP. Trump has made clear his dislike of multilateral trade agreements, pulling out of the TPP agreement with Asian states. However, European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have suggested he is warming to trade talks with the EU, which unifies trade rules for all 28 states. Trump irritated EU leaders during his election campaign last year by hailing Brexit and suggesting other countries might follow Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. Eurosceptic leaders said he would offer Britain a free trade deal once it left. However, EU officials believe Trump has come to appreciate more since taking office the value of European integration to U.S. interests. U.S. businesses have taken advantage of its single market to reduce the costs of exporting to Europe. An EU source said Trump had told Tusk and Juncker he was now worried that Americans may lose jobs as a result of Britain leaving the EU in 2019: He â€œexpressed concern that jobs in the U.S. would be lost because of Brexitâ€? the source said. EU officials said the meeting had been constructive and friendly. Tusk and Juncker joked with Trump about the EU having â€œtwo presidentsâ€?and being â€œtoo complicatedâ€? The U.S. leader appeared to mix the two of them up during remarks in January, deepening concerns in Brussels that the reality TV star in the White House failed to take the European Union seriously. Trump waxed lyrical about his first foreign trip, which has offered distraction to ethics questions at home, notably over alleged campaign ties to Russia. Pope Francis is â€œterrificâ€? Trump told Tusk and Juncker, and his welcome in Saudi Arabia was â€œbeyond anything anyoneâ€™s ever seenâ€? Tusk, a Communist-era dissident who once listed Trump among risks to the world order alongside Russia, China and Islamist violence, said he had tried to impress on the billionaire U.S. president a need for Transatlantic cooperation to promote â€œvaluesâ€?like human rights and not just selfish â€œinterestsâ€? The White House said the meeting had â€œreaffirmed the strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1
0120,"Forget Trump White House, Belgium shows Melania the surreal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - As her reality TV star husband met many of his Western allies for the first time as U.S. president on Thursday, Melania Trump was offered a different take on the surreal by her hosts in Brussels. The first lady, a Slovenian-born former model, toured a museum dedicated to Belgian surrealist painter Rene Magritte in the company of wives of other national leaders who were attending a summit of the NATO military alliance across town. Famed for works like the 1964 â€œself-portraitâ€?of a bowler-hatted man whose face is hidden by an apple or the image of a pipe subtitled â€œCeci nâ€™est pas une pipeâ€?(This is not a pipe), Magritte has much to teach the world about questioning outward appearances, and about self-effacement, Belgian organisers said. â€œYou never know,â€?museum director Michel Draguet said ahead of the first ladyâ€™s visit. â€œMaybe Donald Trump will move from one kind of surrealism to another, thanks to Magritteâ€™s ideas.â€?The outspoken 70-year-old wealthy businessman and TV celebrity stunned many U.S. allies by entering the White House in January. He has broken a mould among world leaders with a style that offers little evidence of self-doubt and ideas that run counter to received wisdom among Western diplomats.     His 47-year-old third wife was joined by other NATO spouses including the devoutly Muslim wife of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan; Brigitte Trogneux, who met Emmanuel Macron when she taught the new French president in school; and Gauthier Destenay, who is married to Luxembourgâ€™s gay prime minister. Speaking later, curator Draguet said Melania Trump â€œshowed great interest in surrealismâ€™s free spirit and inventionâ€? Trumpâ€™s first foreign tour, which has so far taken him to Riyadh, Jerusalem and Rome and will end this weekend at a G7 summit in Sicily, has been presented by aides as reassuring allies that Washington remains a reliable partner under a head of state who faces a series of ethics questions back home. For Charles Michel, the 41-year-old premier whose partner showed the group around Brussels, an itinerary that also took in tea with Belgiumâ€™s queen was also a chance to show those close to power a host country keen to punch above its weight.

Trump told Macron that, contrary to media reports during the race, he had not backed Le Pen and had followed Macronâ€™s campaign with great attention, the source said, adding that the two leaders had spoken in English. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know if Trump had said this to Macron but noted that the two men had good chemistry. Centrist Macron beat National Front leader Le Pen in a May 7 run-off vote after a hard-fought campaign that pitted Macronâ€™s pro-European views against Le Penâ€™s anti-globalisation, anti-EU and anti-immigration stance. After a policeman was killed in Paris in April by a suspected Islamist militant, Trump told the Associated Press he thought the attack would â€œprobably helpâ€?Le Pen because she was the candidate who is â€œstrongest on bordersâ€? However, he said he was not explicitly endorsing Le Pen. Le Pen said she was best placed to defend Franceâ€™s interests in what she called the â€œnew worldâ€?of Trump and Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin.

0123,Former CIA chief says he warned Moscow over election hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former CIA Director John Brennan said on Tuesday it became clear last summer that Russia was attempting to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, and that he warned the head of Russiaâ€™s FSB security service that such interference would hurt U.S. ties. â€œIt should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and  explicit warning that they do not do so,â€?Brennan testified at a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Brennan said he believed he was the first U.S. official to raise the matter of election interference with the Russians, citing a phone conversation he had on Aug. 4 last year with FSB head Alexander Bortnikov. He said he raised published media reports of Russian attempts to meddle in the election with the Russian official, who denied any involvement by Moscow.  Brennan said he briefed then President Barack Obama and other top officials, and that he discussed the matter with both Republican and Democratic U.S. congressional leaders in August and September. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the November presidential election campaign in Republican Donald Trumpâ€™s favor, including by hacking into and leaking the emails of senior Democrats. Moscow has always denied the allegation.

0125,U.S. senator says panel could take up Russia sanctions bill this summer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Thursday the panel could take up a bill as soon as this summer to impose new sanctions on Russia over its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Senator Bob Corker said the panel could move forward on sanctions after hearing from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Some members of the committee, particularly Democrats, had wanted to act more quickly on sanctions over Russian activities that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were intended to help get Republican Donald Trump elected. Corker said he expects Tillerson to report to the committee within weeks about the Trump administrationâ€™s policy toward Russia and the situation in Syria. Corker said he would be willing to consider a sanctions bill soon after that if, as he expected, Tillerson does not demonstrate to the panel that there has been significant change by Russia in Syria, where Moscow has been supporting President Bashar al-Assad in that countryâ€™s six-year-old civil war. â€œIâ€™ve committed to mark up Russia sanctions legislation in the event, the probable event, that the secretary of state cannot show us that thereâ€™s a change of trajectory,â€?Corker said at a committee business meeting. A mark up is a session in which a committee debates legislation and possible amendments. Later in the meeting, the panel overwhelmingly passed legislation to condemn Russian activities including its effort to influence other countriesâ€?elections, aggression in Ukraine and support for Assad. That measure did not include sanctions. Corker and other senators had suggested it would be prudent to wait on sanctions at a delicate time in dealings with Moscow, especially over Syria. Democrats were not pleased at the delay, but said they were willing to wait to hear from the Trump administration. â€œI do look forward to Mr. Tillerson explaining to us the administrationâ€™s Russian policy and what he has seen its impact to be,â€?said Senator Ben Cardin, the committeeâ€™s senior Democrat. If the panel eventually approves sanctions legislation, it would require passage in the full Senate and the House of Representatives before it could go to Trump to sign into law. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the 2016 election in Trumpâ€™s favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Russia has denied the allegation. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Moscow, but Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional probes into the matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said it gives many committee members â€œgreat pauseâ€?that the Trump administration has not acted against Russia for its efforts to influence the election. The United States, under Democratic former President Barack Obama, imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and in December imposed fresh sanctions and ordered the expulsion of Russian suspected spies over the election meddling.

Ross told a House Appropriations subcommittee that an additional $4.5 million requested by the Trump Administration for the International Trade Administrationâ€™s enforcement and compliance section will fund 29 new positions whose primary focus will be the self-initiation of antidumping and antisubsidy investigations. Ross has pledged to have the Commerce Department take the lead in launching trade cases on behalf of industries that lack the resources or the organization to pursue them.  â€œWe will ensure that no country or foreign corporation can take unfair advantage of U.S. markets,â€?Ross said. The enforcement increases are contained in the Trump administrationâ€™s fiscal 2018 budget requests, which propose deep cuts to food assistance, health care and other social programs along with increases in military spending. Commerce also would get a $1 million increase in funding for the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the division that enforces export controls on sensitive technologies. Ross said this would fund 19 new special agents at the division that took the lead in an investigation that led to a criminal fine of $1.19 billion against Chinaâ€™s ZTE (000063.SZ) for violating trade sanctions on Iran and North Korea.   â€œBIS took the lead in cracking this case open.

The vote was 18-3 in favor of the legislation, paving the way for its consideration by the full Senate. Lawmakers who backed the bill said they do not believe that its passage, which would require support by the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump to become law, would violate terms of the international nuclear agreement with Iran reached in 2015. Both Republicans and Democrats have been clamoring for a response to Iranâ€™s ballistic missiles development and other activities.  But the foreign relations committee waited to take up the bill until after Iranâ€™s election on Friday, when President Hassan Rouhani was re-elected with 57 percent of the vote. Rouhani broke the taboo of holding direct talks with the United States and reached the deal to curb Iranâ€™s nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. Trump has criticized the nuclear deal, which was opposed by every Republican in Congress and several Democrats. But he has so far not moved to pull the United States out. Instead, his administration has said it would closely police Iranâ€™s compliance with the bill and review it, with an eye toward possibly modifying it to make it stronger. ",politicsNews,2017/5/25,1

0133,"Despite vow, Trump Organization not tracking all profits from foreign governments","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s businesses say it would be â€œimpracticalâ€?to require customers representing foreign nations to identify themselves, raising questions about how Trump will fulfill a pledge to donate all profits from overseas governments to the U.S. Treasury. The umbrella Trump Organization sent a pamphlet to the general managers at each hotel, golf course, social club, and winery owned or operated by Trump, saying it would only donate profits from guests who declare they represent foreign governments. The pamphlet was sent to the House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee in response to a request for information on how the Trump Organization was fulfilling the pledge Trump made in January.  â€œPutting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand,â€?said the pamphlet. The Trump Organization, Trumpâ€™s lawyer, Sheri Dillon, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.  Dillon announced at a January press conference that Trump would voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his properties to the Treasury. Payments from foreign governments to businesses that profit Trump have drawn criticism from constitutional and ethics experts who say they put Trump in violation of the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s ban on the president receiving â€œemolumentsâ€?from foreign governments.  Emoluments are typically defined in this context as funds or gifts of value. Seven Democratic lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee sent the Republican president a letter on Wednesday asking for a detailed account of â€œany benefits or rewards, financial or otherwiseâ€?he received from foreign governments since he took office on Jan. 20.  The Kuwaiti and Azerbaijani governments have already hosted events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. In March, the Government Accountability Office said it would check whether Trump has made any payments to the U.S. Treasury from profits at his hotels.  The Trump Organization pamphlet identified other entities through which foreign governments may operate, such as state-owned aerospace, defense, banking, finance, healthcare, and energy business entities. Those entities â€œmay not be reasonably identifiable as foreign government entities, and therefore may not be included in our calculation of profit to be donated,â€?the pamphlet read. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the congressional committee that received the pamphlet, said in a response to the Trump Organization that its method for identifying foreign government payments was deficient. Cummings said foreign powers would still be able to provide unconstitutional emoluments to Trump through entities that are funded and controlled but not openly affiliated with foreign governments. â€œThose payments would not be tracked in any way and would be hidden from the American public,â€?Cummings wrote.

0134,Republican congressional candidate in Montana cited with assaulting reporter,"MISSOULA, Mont. (Reuters) - Montana Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte was cited for a misdemeanor on Wednesday after a reporter accused him of physical assault on the eve of a special election to fill the stateâ€™s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Gallatin County sheriffâ€™s office issued the citation for misdemeanor assault hours after Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, said in a Twitter post and in a television interview that Gianforte â€œbody slammedâ€?him, breaking his eyeglasses. The incident, which caps a campaign seen as a possible bellwether for next yearâ€™s mid-term congressional races, took place at an event in Bozeman, where Jacobs sought to question Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape captured by Jacobs and played on cable television networks MSNBC and CNN. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who said she and her crew were in the room preparing to interview Gianforte, wrote that she saw Gianforte as he â€œgrabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground.â€?Acuna, her field producer and photographer then â€œwatched in disbelief as Gianforte began punching (Jacobs) as he moved to top of the reporter.â€?Gianforteâ€™s campaign did not deny Jacobsâ€?allegation but countered in its own statement that Jacobs instigated an altercation by barging into the candidateâ€™s office, shoved a recording device in his face â€œand began asking badgering questions.â€?â€œAfter asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined,â€?campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon wrote. â€œGreg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Gregâ€™s wrist and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground.â€?â€œItâ€™s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,â€?the statement said. Acuna disputed that Jacobs was the aggressor. â€œAt no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,â€?Acuna wrote in her account on the Fox News website.  Interviewed later on MSNBC, Jacobs said he retreated to a parking lot after the confrontation to call his editor and the police. He said he was speaking to MSNBC from a hospital where he was getting his elbow X-rayed. The citation was issued after authorities conducted several interviews and investigated the incident, Sheriff Brian Gootkin said in a statement.  Gianforte has until June 7 to appear in a county court. He faces a $500 fine and six months in jail if convicted, according to Gootkin.  â€œThe nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault,â€?Gootkin said.   In Jacobsâ€?audio tape of the incident, Gianforte is heard shouting: â€œIâ€™m sick and tired of you guys. The last guy who came here, you did the same thing.â€? After loud scuffling noises are heard, Gianforte repeatedly yells: â€œGet the hell out of here.â€?Jacobs is heard saying: â€œYou just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.â€? According to the tape, the confrontation began as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte if he supported a Republican healthcare overhaul bill after the Congressional Budget Office found the measure would cost 23 million Americans their medical insurance coverage by 2026.  Another reporter, Alexis Levinson of BuzzFeed News, who was just outside the office, said on Twitter she saw Jacobsâ€?â€œfeet fly in the air as he hit the floorâ€?amid yelling and commotion. Gianforte later huddled behind closed doors with an aide before leaving the event by car, she said. Tech executive Gianforte is running against Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo-playing political novice who hopes to pull off a surprise victory in the Republican-leaning state.  A victory for Quist could signal trouble ahead for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans as they defend their 24-seat House majority in the 2018 mid-term elections. Quist and Gianforte are vying for the seat vacated when Trump, who carried Montana by more than 20 percentage points, named Ryan Zinke as U.S. interior secretary. Republicans have held the seat for two decades and Gianforte was still the favorite. However, both sides say the race was tightening as Quist focused on criticism of Republican efforts to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

0136,Russians discussed how to influence Trump via his aides: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior Russian intelligence and political officials discussed how to influence Donald Trump through his advisers according to information gathered by American spies last summer, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, Citing three current and former U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence, the newspaper said the conversations focused on Paul Manafort, then the Trump presidential campaign chairman, and Michael Flynn, a retired general who was then advising Trump. U.S. congressional committees and a special counsel named by the Justice Department this month are investigating whether there was Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the possibility of collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. The controversy has engulfed Trumpâ€™s young administration since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago amid the agencyâ€™s investigation of possible Russia ties. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. The New York Times report was the latest indication of the depth of concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian efforts to tip Novemberâ€™s election toward Trump as he battled Democrat Hillary Clinton. On May 18, Reuters reported that Flynn and other advisers to Trumpâ€™s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, citing current and former U.S. officials.     On Tuesday, former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers he had noticed contacts between associates of Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia during the campaign and grew concerned Moscow had sought to lure Americans down â€œa treasonous path.â€?In its report, the New York Times said some Russians boasted about how well they knew Flynn, who was subsequently named Trumpâ€™s national security adviser before being dismissed less than a month after the Republican took office. Others discussed leveraging their ties to Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed president of Ukraine living in exile in Russia, who at one time had worked closely with Manafort, who was dismissed from Trumpâ€™s campaign, the newspaper reported. Separately, Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, told Reuters via text message that he would testify before the House Intelligence Committee but was â€œstill working out details.â€?â€œNothing (is) fully confirmed at this stage,â€?Page wrote, adding that if invited, he would also testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, but had yet to receive such a request. ABC News, which first reported on Pageâ€™s planned testimony, said he would testify before the House panel on June 6. A spokesman for the committee declined comment on whether Page would testify. In a letter to the panel seen by Reuters, Page accused Brennan of offering a â€œbiased viewpointâ€?in Tuesdayâ€™s testimony. On Wednesday morning, the top Democrat on the committee said it would subpoena Flynn in its probe into alleged Russian meddling in the presidential election after he declined to appear before the panel. â€œWe will be following up with subpoenas, and those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,â€?Representative Adam Schiff told journalists at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday they would subpoena two of Flynnâ€™s businesses after he declined to hand over documents in its separate Russia probe. Flynn, a retired general, is a key witness in the Russia investigations because of his ties to Moscow.  He was fired from his position at the White House in February, after less than a month on the job, for failing to disclose the content of talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

0137,"Under U.S. Republican bill, 23 million would lose health coverage: watchdog","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill passed by U.S. House Republicans would cause 23 million people to lose healthcare coverage by 2026 while de-stabilizing health insurance markets in some states and making it hard for sick people to buy insurance, a budget watchdog agency said on Wednesday. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan group of experts who analyze U.S. legislation, said the bill would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026. The report could give added ammunition to Democrats who have accused President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans of putting sick and low-income people at risk with their effort to roll back former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature 2010 healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act but often called Obamacare. The report also complicates the job of Senate Republicans - some of whom already have doubts about the House bill - as they craft their own healthcare legislation. Republicans have sought to unravel Obamacare since its passage and Trump promised on the campaign trail to repeal it, saying it is too costly and an overreach by government in the healthcare market. As Trump and Republican leaders sought to bring wavering lawmakers on board with the House bill, they added a controversial last-minute amendment that would give states leeway to drop an Obamacare requirement that forces insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same insurance rates. Another change would allow states to decide whether to require insurers to cover health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs that are mandatory under current law. But the CBO report said the amendment would make it difficult or impossible for people in poor health to purchase comprehensive coverage in some states. â€œPeople who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non-group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all,â€?the CBO report said. The CBO said markets for people to buy individual insurance plans could then become â€œunstableâ€?in states that choose to waive the Obamacare requirements for coverage of pre-existing medical conditions and essential health benefits. Even before the report, many Republican senators were wary of the House version of the healthcare bill, saying it unraveled Obamacare too much and too quickly. About 20 million people gained insurance under Obamacare. The House bill would eliminate most Obamacare taxes that help subsidize private health coverage for individuals, roll back the governmentâ€™s Medicaid health plan for the poor and disabled and replace the lawâ€™s income-based tax credits for buying medical coverage with credits based on age. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to draft its own version of the healthcare bill in the coming months. McConnell, however, told Reuters on Wednesday he does not yet know how Republicans will get the necessary votes. â€œThis is a very challenging undertaking,â€?McConnell said.    After the release of the CBO report, several Republican senators said they could not support the House bill. â€œWhile I am in favor of repealing Obamacare, I am opposed to the American Health Care Act in its current form,â€?Republican Senator Dean Heller said in a statement. Republican Senator Susan Collins said too many people would lose insurance and that older and low-income Americans would be hurt. House Republicans, who argue their healthcare bill would allow insurance markets to function more efficiently, focused on the projected budget savings from it and a finding in the CBO report that said insurance premiums for some people would decline. Groups representing hospitals, insurers and doctors who opposed the House bill said the CBO report showed the Senate should start fresh with an eye to maintaining coverage and benefits. Democrats also blasted the bill and said the CBO report proved it would be catastrophic for millions of people who would lose health insurance. â€œThe report makes clear Trumpcare would be a cancer on the American healthcare system,â€?Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference. The new CBO score predicts the AHCA would cover 1 million more Americans than Republicansâ€?previous version of the bill, which the agency estimated would have left 24 million more people uninsured than Obamacare in 2026. To allay concerns about coverage of people with pre-existing illnesses, House Republicans allocated an additional $8 billion over five years in their bill to help sick people pay for insurance premiums but the CBO said the money would not be enough to help them afford coverage. The CBO said premiums would fall for younger people and rise for older people in states that did not waive Obamacare requirements for an overall decline of about 4 percent. In states that made moderate changes to their markets, representing about one-third of the U.S. population, premiums would fall 20 percent on average. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares of hospitals affected by the cuts to Medicaid, like Community Health Systems, and health insurers specializing in Medicaid, such as Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) and Centene Corp (CNC.N)Â unchanged in light after-hours trading. The Republicansâ€?first attempt at undoing Obamacare this year resulted in a setback for the Trump agenda in March. Conservative and moderate Republican factions in the House were opposed to the initial legislation and the leadership decided not to put it up for a vote. ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0138,"Exclusive - Hate the tweets, love the agenda: McConnell on Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, says he could live without the drama surrounding President Donald Trumpâ€™s White House, but from a policy standpoint sees the new commander-in-chief as a solid ally in the mode of any president from his party. McConnell told Reuters that he finds Trump accessible and that they talk regularly, even more frequently than he spoke to the last Republican president, George W. Bush. While McConnell would not discuss the substance of their conversations, he said the two are able to be frank with one another without it damaging their relationship. â€œWe have a good relationship. Heâ€™s never, as far as I can tell, gotten angry at me - in my presence, anyway. We have a good working relationship,â€?McConnell said during a roundtable with Reuters reporters on Wednesday. McConnell, who last week said he hoped to see â€œless dramaâ€?from the White House, said that Trump does not always take his advice. â€œHe knows, as you all know, that Iâ€™ve not been a fan of the tweets and the extracurricular comments. I said last week we could do with a little less drama,â€?McConnell said. Cracking a grin, he added, â€œThe reason Iâ€™m smiling - obviously, heâ€™s disinclined to take my advice on some things. But it has not impaired the ability to communicate and convey my opinion, which I do frequently.â€?In matters of style, McConnell and Trump are a study in contrasts. The Senate majority leader is a taciturn traditionalist steeped in the ways of Washington, after more than three decades in Congress. Trump, a real estate magnate and reality TV celebrity who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency in January, airs his views regularly on Twitter and has vowed to drain what he calls the â€œswampâ€?of the U.S. capital. McConnell declined to say if he had advised Trump to speak less about the controversy dogging the administration: questions about whetherÂ associates of Trump colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and concerns about Trumpâ€™s abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as the agency was probing the Russia matter. On questions concerning Russia, McConnell stuck to his script. â€œI think all of that is going to be handled by the special counsel and the Senate intelligence committee, and Iâ€™m confident in their ability to do the job,â€?he said, referring to a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department last week, and to one of several congressional panels probing the Russia issue. Some Republican lawmakers and lobbyists worry the issue will slow legislative plans. Republicans have yet to chalk up significant legislative achievements despite being in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. But McConnell said he and Trump are aligned in putting an overhaul of Obamacare and a rewrite of the tax code at the top of their agenda. McConnell acknowledged there had been doubts within his party during the 2016 campaign about what Trump would do in the White House. â€œThis was a guy who was giving fund-raisers for (Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer four or five years ago,â€?McConnell said. But McConnell, whose wife Elaine Chao is a member of Trumpâ€™s cabinet as transportation secretary, said he sees Trump as someone who has embraced Republican orthodoxy. â€œIn other words, what the administration is doing, not only am I comfortable with it, but I think the vast majority of Republicans in Congress feel that this is a right-of-center presidency, which is what we had hopedâ€?for, he said. â€œIf you look at what the president is actually for, it strikes me as indistinguishable from what a President Jeb Bush or a President Marco Rubio would have been advocating: deregulation, tax reform, repeal and replace of Obamacare, judges like Neil Gorsuch,â€?McConnell said. Trumpâ€™s relationship with Congress has been boosted by the frequent and â€œvery significantâ€?presence of Vice President Mike Pence in the halls of Capitol Hill, McConnell said, describing Penceâ€™s role as â€œserious value-added.â€?â€œHe is, in my view, kind of the de facto congressional relations guy for the administration,â€?he said, noting Pence, a former Indiana governor and Republican congressman, has strong relationships on the Hill. McConnell described Pence as playing a similar role with Congress as Vice President Dick Cheney did during the George W. Bush administration: listening and sometimes weighing in on discussions about healthcare and tax reform. â€œItâ€™s been really helpful because members feel like they can go over and whisper in his ear about whatever their particular problem is, and something will be done about it, because theyâ€™ve kind of elevated it to a higher level,â€?McConnell said.

0139,Treasury chief says reviewing Iran's aircraft licenses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, department head Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. â€œWe will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives,â€?Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. â€œI can assure you thatâ€™s a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president.â€?Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iranâ€™s nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trumpâ€™s Middle East trip, in which he called on Iran to stop funding â€œterrorists and militias.â€?The review suggests that Trumpâ€™s support for Boeingâ€™s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has accused Washington of supporting terrorism by backing rebels in Syria and says halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. Mnuchin told the Ways and Means hearing that sanctions â€œreally workâ€?and were responsible for bringing Iran to the negotiating table ahead of the nuclear deal.  For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the widebody jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to IranAir by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year.  Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year under plans that include IranAirâ€™s still-tenative order. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts.    They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need U.S. licenses because of their reliance on U.S. parts. â€œBoeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iranâ€™s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iranâ€™s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval,â€?a spokeswoman said by email. An Airbus spokesman had no immediate comment. In its first business with the Islamic Republic since U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher stance on Iran in January, Boeing last month announced a tentative deal to sell 30 jets to Iran Aseman Airlines, its third-largest carrier. Boeing said it would apply for licenses for the deal. People involved in the deals say the Treasury has so far issued licenses for the main contracts between Western suppliers  and IranAir, but that many need to be renewed beyond 2020. IranAir does not need further approvals to take delivery of the first 70 or so aircraft, they say, though legal experts have said the U.S. Treasury can withdraw licenses at any time. About a third of the Airbus jets, or some 37, also are due to arrive by 2020, including three already delivered. IranAir last week took delivery of four ATR turboprops and plans to take the remaining 16 next year.  Even with licenses in place, bankers say talks between Iran and Western banks to fund deliveries of the aircraft have been disrupted by concerns that sanctions could be reintroduced or that banks could be penalized for dealing with Iran.

0141,"On trip abroad, Trump stays on script, but will it last?","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - He still has a chance for missteps, but so far on his maiden international trip, Donald Trump has managed to avoid major stumbles and has stuck to the script in a way his advisers have wanted him to do for months. Â Â Â  The U.S. presidentâ€™s rare display of discipline is in part a result of a desperate need for some smooth sailing. He began the trip in scandal mode, accused of impeding justice by firing former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey for not stopping a federal probe into his campaignâ€™s Russia ties.  Â Â Â  Whether it will hold is unclear. He is in a portion of his nine-day trip, in Brussels for a NATO summit and later in Sicily for a Group of Seven conclave, where he will meet with European leaders who are at sharp odds with him on many issues. Â Â Â  Trumpâ€™s change comes after increasingly loud alarm bells sounded from Republican congressional leaders, who say he must tamp down the tirades and tantrums that have contributed to a dismal public approval rating of about 38 percent.  Just in the past month alone, Trump used Twitter to issue a veiled threat to Comey, warning that he â€œbetter hope that there are no â€˜tapesâ€?of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!â€?And when he fired Comey, White House aides said the move was based on a Justice Department recommendation that said Comey had mishandled the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clintonâ€™s handling of classified information last year. Trump blew up that reason the next day, saying he had already decided to fire Comey when the Justice recommendation came in because the FBI man was a â€œshowboat.â€?Trumpâ€™s advisers planned the overseas journey trip in such a way as to keep the president busy with back-to-back meetings and appearances. This has given him little time for tweet storms and cable news watching. It sometimes has left him fatigued, as manifested when he canceled an evening forum with young people in Riyadh. Â Â Â  As they normally do when he travels, staff members have managed to provide him with some creature comforts, like keeping bags of potato chips at easy reach. Â Â Â  The president has limited his interactions with reporters, taking few questions. As a result, the Russia issue came up only once â€?during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Â Â Â Â Initial plans for an end-of-the-trip news conference in Sicily have been set aside, meaning there are fewer chances for him to veer off script, but less opportunity to promote his achievements. When Trump has talked to the news media, his responses to questions have been fairly brief and non-substantive. Asked about his meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday at the Vatican, Trump kept it simple despite the differences between him and Francis on issues like climate change. Â Â Â  â€œGreat...We had a fantastic meeting...We are liking Italy very much, and it was an honor to meet with the pope,â€?Trump said. Â Â  He has also reined in some of his hyperbole.Â After boasting earlier this year that finding a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians should not be all that hard, Trump acknowledged that maybe it would be hard after all.  Â Â Â  â€œIâ€™veÂ heard itâ€™s one of the toughest deals of all,â€?he said. â€œBut I have a feeling weâ€™re going to get there eventually. I hope.â€?Â Â Â  Aides said most every word spoken was written carefully with some thought of the message that would be sent. Most speeches were performed with a Teleprompter to keep Trump from drifting off into his own ad libs. Â Â Â  â€œHe understands that even the slightest phrasing can have big implications,â€?said a senior White House official. â€œHeâ€™s worked really hard on being directly involved in the preparation.â€?Â Â Â  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that behind the scenes, Trump has been calibrating his style to fit the leader who he is meeting and the urgency of the issue he is discussing. Â Â Â  â€œHe tends to dial the urgency up and therefore the style dials up,â€?Tillerson, noting that when talking to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, â€œHe was very energized because he does feel thereâ€™s a certain sense of urgency for these parties to finally get on with it.â€?Trump has been on script before only to lapse. Privately, aides realize this could happen again. Â Â Â  â€œHe is who he is,â€?one aide said. â€œHeâ€™s definitely someone who speaks his mind.â€?Â Â Â  Trump has found himself on this trip increasingly reliant on a core group of his inner circle: Son-in-law Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser; daughter Ivanka, who is Kushnerâ€™s wife; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; economic adviser Gary Cohn; national security adviser H.R. McMaster and deputy national security adviser for strategy, Dina Powell. Â Â Â  The more disciplined Trump was a victory for Kushner, who organized the trip around some specific objectives, such as a $110 billion arms deal for Saudi Arabia and Trumpâ€™s visit to holy sites in Israel, including his visit to the Western Wall, a first for a U.S. president.  Â Â Â  â€œWeâ€™re very focused on the substance of the actions and then ultimately on delivering results,â€?said a senior administration official. ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0142,"Exclusive: McConnell frets about healthcare, hopeful on tax overhaul","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he does not yet know how Republicans will amass the votes needed to pass legislation now being crafted to dismantle Obamacare, but expressed some optimism on another top priority, overhauling the tax code. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, McConnell said healthcare and taxes still top the Republican legislative agenda, and he added that he will not reach out to the minority Democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark. McConnell also said he has not asked the White House for input as the Senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the Republican-led House of Representatives passed its version on May 4, but may do so in the future. Excluding Democratic involvement will leave McConnell, a conservative 75-year-old Kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker, a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals, which are also at the head of Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s policy agenda. A repeal of Obamacare was one of Trumpâ€™s leading campaign promises last year. Asked about behind-the-scenes work among Senate Republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill, McConnell said, â€œI donâ€™t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But thatâ€™s the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is Iâ€™m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose,â€?McConnell said. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. McConnell opened the interview by saying, â€œThereâ€™s not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare.â€?He declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank-and-file Republican senators and gauge their support. On the other hand, he said, prospects for passage of major tax legislation were â€œpretty good.â€?While this too will be difficult, McConnell said, it is â€œnot in my view quite as challenging as healthcare.â€?Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress want to cut tax rates across the board, but a House proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers. The House narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, that was Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature legislative achievement, overcoming unified opposition from Democrats. On Wednesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House-passed bill would result in 23 million people losing health insurance coverage by 2026, a sobering figure for Senate Republicans as they mull action. The CBO also said federal budget deficits would fall by $119 billion over 10 years under that bill. Asked if he was getting any guidance from the White House on healthcare legislation, McConnell said, â€œHonestly I havenâ€™t asked for any. I told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful.â€?McConnell said Trump and Pence could play an important role when it comes to â€œwhippingâ€?up support for whatever bill is produced. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the House and Senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to Trump for his signature. With Republicans holding a slim Senate majority, McConnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hard-line conservative Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral. Cruz is a member of a working group within the Senate in charge of crafting the Senate Obamacare repeal legislation. â€œIâ€™m grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here,â€?McConnell said. Republicans face a tricky balancing act. Because they cannot expect any Democratic support and have a razor-thin majority, they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many Republican moderates. Since it became law in 2010, Republicans have railed against Obamacare, arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in Americansâ€?healthcare decisions. They have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most Obamacare taxes, reduces federal spending in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states. McConnell in the past has promised to undo Obamacare â€œroot and branch.â€?Now that Republicans are in a position to do so with control of both Congress and the White House, they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan. The Republican leader compared the effort to solving a Rubikâ€™s Cube. Many Senate Republicans have misgivings about the House-passed legislation, which Democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance, benefit the wealthy and roll back Obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. McConnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill, saying, â€œWeâ€™re working on a separate approach.â€?In taking a Republican-only approach to healthcare and taxes, McConnell said of Democrats, â€œTheyâ€™re not interested in doing what weâ€™re interested in doing.â€?McConnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. He also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against Iran, due for debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week, and renewal of a Food and Drug Administration user-fee program that expires later this year.

0143,Trump budget cut bid would make it 'impossible' for U.N.: spokesman,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s bid to slash funding for the United Nations would make it â€œimpossibleâ€?for it to continue its essential work, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday, adding that the organization was ready to discuss reform with Washington. The Trump proposal cuts about a third from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. This includes cutting some $1 billion from a U.N. peacekeeping funding and a steep cut to funding for international organizations. The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. These assessed contributions are agreed by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. â€œThe figures presented would simply make it impossible for the U.N. to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,â€?Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. Congress sets the federal government budget, and Republicans who control both houses and Democrats have said they do not support such drastic cuts. Trump has said the U.S. share of the U.N. budgets was â€œunfair.â€?The General Assembly is currently negotiating the peacekeeping budget from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 and will later this year negotiate the next U.N. regular budget. Trump wants to cap the U.S. peacekeeping contribution at 25 percent. The United States is reviewing each of the 16 U.N. peacekeeping missions as the annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council in a bid to cut costs. During a lunch with U.N. Security Council ambassadors at the White House last month, Trump described the U.S. contributions to the United Nations as â€œpeanuts compared to the important workâ€?as he pushed the world body to reform. â€œThe Secretary-General is totally committed to reforming the United Nations,â€?Dujarric said. â€œWe stand ready to discuss with the United States and any other member state how best we can create a more cost-effective organization to pursue our shared goals and values.â€?Trumpâ€™s budget proposal included a 44 percent cut to funding for international organizations, but does not specify the cuts, other than â€œfunding for organizations that work against U.S. foreign policy interests.â€?The State Department said last month it was ending funding for the U.N. Population Fund, an agency focused on family planning and maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. Guterres warned the cut could have â€œdevastating effects.â€?U.N. agencies such as the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the childrenâ€™s agency UNICEF, and the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), are funded by governments voluntarily. In 2016, the United States was the top contributor to the UNDPâ€™s core budget, with an $83 million donation; the leading donor to UNICEFâ€™s core budget in 2015 with $132 million; and the fourth-largest donor to the UNFPA, giving $75 million.

0144,Exclusive: McConnell expects bipartisan support for bill reauthorizing FDA user fees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters on Wednesday he expects bipartisan support for approval of a bill authorizing taxpayer and industry funding for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act would let the FDA continue to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from drugmakers and medical device companies to partially cover the cost of reviewing new products, with U.S. taxpayers funding the remainder. â€œItâ€™s an extremely important bill that I think weâ€™ll be able to move on a bipartisan basis,â€?McConnell said in an interview. [L1N1IQ1CH] The FDA has been charging companies to review their products since 1992. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed in his 2018 budget that the industry pay the full cost of drug and medical device reviews.  The industry at present pays about 60 percent. That proposal is unlikely to be approved in this cycle. Reauthorization of the user fee bill is typically negotiated between the FDA and industry over a period of several years. Earlier this month, the bill was approved by a Senate panel by a 21-2 vote. It must be renegotiated every five years. The FDA reviews drugs for approval or rejection for many companies, including major ones such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Johnson and Johnson. Pharmaceutical companies based overseas, including Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG, also pay these fees for U.S.-approved drugs.",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0145,"Vermont governor snuffs legal pot, tells lawmakers to 'get it right'","(Reuters) - Vermontâ€™s governor on Wednesday halted, at least temporarily, efforts to become the ninth state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, but offered to work with state legislators to resolve what he cited as the billâ€™s shortcomings.  In vetoing the measure to decriminalize possession of small amounts of the drug for adults and to pave the way for a regulated market in the state, Republican Governor Phil Scott stressed he was not philosophically opposed to the concept, which he said he views â€œthrough a libertarian lens.â€?But in an effort to â€œget it right,â€?he said the bill needs to improve protections for children and motorists. â€œI want to reiterate that we can all work together on this issue in a thoughtful and responsible way,â€?the governor said at his weekly news conference in Montpelier. Scott said the bill should â€œmake clearâ€?that there will be no change in current penalties for giving or selling the drug to minors under 21 or near schools, and it should have stiffer penalties for smoking marijuana while driving or in front of children. The Marijuana Regulatory Commission the bill would create needs to include police, health and tax collecting representatives, and should be responsible for coming up with impairment limits for drivers, testing mechanisms, and education and prevention programs for minors, he added. â€œIf the legislature agrees to make the changes I am seeking, we can move this discussion forward in a way that ensures the public health and safety of our communities and our children continues to come first,â€?said Scott. The Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, said it was disappointed, but held out hope that the governor and legislators would reach a compromise. â€œMost Vermonters want to end marijuana prohibition, and it is critical that the legislature respond by passing a revised legalization bill this summer,â€?said Matt Simon, the groupâ€™s New England political director.      The bill, which won the approval of the stateâ€™s House of Representatives 79-66 and the state Senate 20-9, both of which are controlled by Democrats, would have made Vermont the first state to legalize recreational marijuana legislatively, instead of by popular referendum. Of the eight states and the District of Columbia that have legalized recreational marijuana, two - Massachusetts and Maine - are nearby, while Canada, to Vermontâ€™s north, is considering legalization. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law.      ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1

0147,Senior U.S. lawmakers call to condemn Turkey after Washington street brawl,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. lawmakers want the House of Representatives to formally condemn Turkish security forcesâ€?violent response to a street protest in Washington during a recent visit by President Tayyip Erdogan, a congressional aide said on Wednesday. The leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and top Republican and Democratic House leaders are co-sponsoring a resolution condemning the violence against peaceful protesters and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. The measure introduced by Foreign Affairs Republican Chairman Ed Royce and ranking Democrat Eliot Engel, Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, also calls for measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. The brawl that erupted on May 16 between protesters and Turkish security personnel outside the Turkish ambassadorâ€™s residence during Erdoganâ€™s visit to meet U.S. President Donald Trump has caused a diplomatic dispute between the two NATO allies. At least 11 people were injured in the encounter, two so seriously they had to go to the hospital. Turkey blamed the violence on demonstrators linked to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party while Washingtonâ€™s police chief described the incident as a â€œbrutal attackâ€?on peaceful protesters. The U.S. State Department said in a statement the conduct of Turkish security personnel during the incident was â€œdeeply disturbing.â€?And the Turkish government summoned the U.S. ambassador in Ankara to discuss the â€œviolent incidents.â€? The congressional aide said the Foreign Affairs Committee would take up the resolution on Thursday.     ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0148,U.S. lawmakers gear up to block Trump plan to slash oil stockpile,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration plan to sell off half the U.S. emergency crude oil stockpile to help balance the budget faces opposition in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried the proposal would undermine the drilling industry and make the country vulnerable to supply shocks.  The White Houseâ€™s 2018 budget proposal, sent to Congress on Tuesday, proposes raising nearly $16.6 billion by 2027 by gradually selling millions of barrels from the reserve, which now holds about 688 million barrels of oil in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. News of the proposal had briefly sent oil prices tumbling on concern it would oversupply the market, but prices recovered and finished slightly higher on hopes that OPEC and other countries would extend supply cuts. Â Â Â Â â€œWe should not be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now,â€?said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, a leading oil producer state. â€œWe should use the SPR for emergencies, and selling now would disrupt the markets.â€?The SPR sell-off plan is part of a broader White House proposal to balance the U.S. budget that is meant as starting point to debate policy with Congress - which will ultimately pass its own version.  Whether the SPR proposal will survive the budget process could depend in part on Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a member of the appropriations committee and the head of the chamberâ€™s energy panel. In 2015, when Congress was considering selling a modest amount of oil from the reserve to help fund a transportation bill, Murkowski opposed the idea, saying the reserve should not be used as an ATM.  Murkowski did not directly address the SPR plan in a statement on Tuesday, but she said â€œa Presidentâ€™s budget is more of a vision than anything else.â€?Efforts to reach Murkowski on Tuesday were not successful. Â Â Â Â Murkowskiâ€™s Democratic counterpart on the energy panel, however, raised concerns that liquidating half of the reserve would run counter to the original purpose of the facility, which Congress created in 1975 to protect against global oil disruptions that could harm the U.S. economy.  Â Â Â Â â€œWe are not going to let Donald Trump auction off our energy security to the highest bidder,â€?Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said in an email. The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s led to chaos at U.S. filling stations and fears of long-term damage to the economy. Much has changed since then: U.S. oil production has surged in recent years and supply from Canada has increased, displacing a large portion of the imports from some less stable Middle Eastern suppliers. U.S. oil imports from the producer group OPEC have fallen to less than 3.2 million bpd in 2016 from more than 5.4 million barrels per day in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Richard Newell, a former head of the EIA, noted that the plan could cause the United States to break its obligation as a member of the International Energy Agency to hold 90 daysâ€?worth of oil imports on reserve. Currently, the SPR holds about 145 daysâ€?worth of oil imports.Â Â   â€œThere are a number of possible scenarios under which reducing the SPR to the levels proposed would violate our IEA treaty obligations,â€?he said.  Lawmakers from both parties also said releasing oil from the SPR could dampen crude prices and hurt drilling companies still recovering from a price crash in 2014. Trump had campaigned on a promise to revive the drilling industry. â€œPutting that much oil on the market, you will see a lot of layoffs in the energy business,â€?said Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas.  Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget told reporters on Tuesday, however, there are ways to tap the SPR slowly and â€œtelegraph it over the course of timeâ€?to avoid having a dramatic impact on prices.  Representative Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said the SPR infrastructure needs improvement because tanks and other equipment are constantly exposed to corrosive salt air. But he did not rush to embrace a sell-off of oil, saying that the larger budget deserves careful scrutiny. Some oil industry representatives also came out against the proposal. Randall Luthi, President of the National Ocean Industries Association said the plan to cut the SPR in half threatened national security. He added he also opposed a proposal in the budget to cut federal oil royalty payments to U.S. Gulf Coast states - funds meant to help them defend their coasts from hurricane damage.

0149,"Pope asks Trump to be peacemaker, gives him environmental letter","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be a peacemaker at their first meeting on Wednesday after they exchanged sharp words last year, and Trump promised he would not forget the pontiffâ€™s message. Under clear blue skies, Trump received a tribute from the Swiss Guard in a Vatican courtyard when he arrived. He entered a small elevator taking him to the third floor of the Apostolic Palace and, after a long ceremonial walk past frescoed corridors, shook the popeâ€™s hand at the entrance to the private study that the frugal pontiff uses only for official occasions. Before the door of the wood-lined elevator closed, a Vatican protocol official was heard quipping to the president that it was not â€œlike Trump Tower in New Yorkâ€? Francis smiled faintly as he greeted Trump outside the study and was not as outgoing as he sometimes is with visiting heads of state. Trump, seeming subdued, said, â€œIt is a great honor.â€?Even when the two were sitting at the popeâ€™s desk in the presence of photographers and reporters, the pope avoided the  small talk that usually occurs before the media is ushered out. The two spoke privately for about 30 minutes with translators. Both men looked far more relaxed at the end of the private meeting, with the pope smiling and joking with Trump and his wife Melania. Francisâ€™s interpreter could be heard translating a comment by the pope to the First Lady: â€œWhat do you give him to eat?â€?Francis then gave Trump a small sculptured olive tree and told him through the interpreter that it symbolized peace. â€œIt is my desire that you become an olive tree to construct peace,â€?the Pope said, speaking in Spanish. Trump responded: â€œWe can use peace.â€?Francis also gave Trump a signed copy of his 2017 peace message whose title is â€œNonviolence -  A Style of Politics for Peaceâ€? and a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter on the need to protect the environment from the effects of climate change. â€œWell, Iâ€™ll be reading them,â€?Trump said. During his election campaign, Trump said scientific findings that human economic activity contributed to global warming were a hoax. As president, he has proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations. Trump gave the pope a boxed set of five first-edition books by murdered U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King. As Trump and the pope said goodbye at the door of the study, Trump told him: â€œThank you, thank you. I wonâ€™t forget what you said.â€?Asked how the meeting with the pope went, Trump said: â€œGreat. He is something. He is really good. We had a fantastic meeting.â€?A Vatican statement said the meeting was â€œcordialâ€?and that the Vatican hoped there could be â€œserene collaborationâ€?between the U.S. government and the American Catholic Church, including â€œassistance to immigrantsâ€? The U.S. Catholic Church hierarchy opposes Trumpâ€™s attempt to cut federal assistance for cities that give sanctuary to illegal immigrants. It also opposes his plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The pope said last year a man who thinks about building walls and not bridges is â€œnot Christianâ€? Trump, who was a candidate at the time, responded that it was â€œdisgracefulâ€?of the Argentine-born pope, who represents just over half of the worldâ€™s two billion Christians, to question his faith. The meeting with the pope was the third stop on Trumpâ€™s nine-day foreign tour, and part of his world tour of religions after meeting leaders of Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia and visiting holy sites in Jerusalem. Trump at first did not plan to stop in Rome during his visit to Europe, which some in the Vatican saw as a snub. When he changed his mind, the Vatican squeezed him in at 8:30 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, an unusual day and an unusually early time. He later flew to Brussels where he was to meet Belgiumâ€™s king and prime minister on Wednesday evening before a day of meetings with European Union and NATO leaders on Thursday.

0150,Trump retains Marc Kasowitz as private attorney for Russia probe: source," (This May 23 story corrects name to Fox Business Network in second paragraph) By Julia Edwards Ainsley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has tapped a longtime legal adviser to serve as his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his campaign worked with Russia in last yearâ€™s election, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters Tuesday.  Fox Business Network and ABC first reported that Trump hired Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer known as a tenacious litigator, to represent him in a Justice Department investigation headed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. The appointment of a private attorney may indicate that Trump is seriously considering the impact the federal investigation could have on him personally and that he may wish to protect himself should others in his administration turn against him. The source said Kasowitz is expected to bring other lawyers on to work as a team to protect Trump.  Other candidates for the job, including Brendan Sullivan and Robert Giuffra, withdrew their names from consideration, the source said.  â€œHe can be aggressive - heâ€™s got that in him for sure,â€?said John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, who has worked with and opposite Kasowitz. â€œHe also can be smooth as silk, respectful and deferential.â€? Kasowitz and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Kasowitz has represented Trump for more than 15 years but he is not known as a criminal defense lawyer. During last yearâ€™s presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story. He also assisted in the defense of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million. Trump has looked to Kasowitzâ€™s firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm, as the next U.S. attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Kasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the countryâ€™s largest bank, which is being accused in a U.S. federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.  The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counselâ€™s Office, led by Donald McGahn. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaignâ€™s possible ties to Russia. Several congressional committees and the FBI are also investigating the matter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Controversy has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago as Comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia.

0151,U.S. House Democrats seek info from Deutsche Bank on Trump accounts,"(Reuters) - Democrats on a U.S. of House of Representatives panel have asked Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) to provide information on whether any accounts connected to President Donald Trump have ties to Russia, adding another dimension to probes into connections between Moscow and Trump. Democrats on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee said on Wednesday they had sent a letter the previous day to Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan seeking details of internal reviews to determine if Trumpâ€™s loans for  his real estate business were backed by the Russian government.  The congressional inquiry also seeks information about a Russian â€œmirror tradingâ€?scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. â€œCongress remains in the dark on whether loans Deutsche Bank made to President Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government, or were in any way connected to Russia,â€?the Democrats wrote. â€œIt is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews.â€?The Democrats requested the documents from the bank, but cannot compel it to hand over the information. The committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but that would require cooperation from committee Republicans who make up the majority of the panel because the party has control of the House. No Republicans signed on to the document request. Citing media reports, the Democrats called for the bank to hand over any documents tied to internal reviews of Trumpâ€™s personal accounts at the bank. They also said the bank should  state publicly that it had reviewed both the â€œmirror tradingâ€?scheme and Trumpâ€™s accounts.  Mirror trading involved buying stocks, for example, in Moscow in rubles, with related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through a bankâ€™s London branch. They also called on the bank to name an independent auditor to verify the results of the reviews, which should be turned over to the committee â€œas soon as reasonably practicable.â€?Renee Calabro, a spokeswoman for Deutsche, declined to comment. The House panel request to Deutsche comes as Trump is mired in controversy over FBI and congressional probes into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion between the Moscow and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion. ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1

0154,Texas House approves new voter ID bill after setbacks in court,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Texas House of Representatives gave preliminary approval on Tuesday to a new bill on showing identification when voting after a previous voter ID law was struck down by U.S. courts which said it discriminated against black and Hispanic people. The measure called Senate Bill 5 is intended to remedy flaws found by courts in the previous Republican-backed law. It allows people who cannot produce an authorized photo ID to show other documentation such as a utility bill or bank statement and sign an affidavit stating that they had a reasonable impediment in presenting an authorized ID. Critics contend the measure backed by the Republican-dominated lawmakers will still exclude ethnic minorities, who tend to support Democrats, and imposes harsh penalties of up to 10 years in prison for lying on the affidavit. Texas is the most-populous Republican controlled state. For more than 20 years, the party has won every statewide race for offices such as governor or U.S. senator. But shifting demographics have given hopes to Democrats that they can one day turn the state to their column, which would alter the U.S. political landscape.  The original voter ID measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican. It was considered one of the nationâ€™s strictest and has been subject to years of court challenges, with the laws opponents saying it could exclude up to 600,000 voters. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Texas seeking to revive the stateâ€™s strict Republican-backed voter-identification requirements. Critics had said the Texas law and similar statutes enacted in other Republican-governed states were tailored to make it harder for minorities including black and Hispanic voters, who are less likely to have the authorized IDs, to cast ballots. Backers of these laws have said they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, despite little evidence of such fraud. Both the previous law and the measure in the Texas legislature list authorized photo ID to include: a driverâ€™s license, U.S. military ID, a U.S. passport and a Texas concealed handgun license. The Texas Senate approved SB 5 in March and on Tuesday the state House of Representatives preliminarily approved the measure. Final votes on the bill may be held on Wednesday, media reported.  Texas used a similar system as outlined in the bill in the 2016 election after being ordered by a federal court to weaken its voter ID law.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/24,1
0155,Trump seeks to slash $3.6 trillion of spending in austere budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked lawmakers on Tuesday to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, taking aim at healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor in an austere budget that also boosts the military. Republicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - will decide whether to make politically sensitive cuts, and the proposal is unlikely to be approved in its current form. Although it is not expected to survive on Capitol Hill, the proposal puts numbers on Trumpâ€™s vision of a government that radically cuts assistance to lower-income Americans. The biggest savings would come from cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor, which are embedded in a Republican healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Trump wants lawmakers to cut at least $610 billion from Medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps over a decade. He seeks to balance the budget within 10 years.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan policy organization, said the plan relied on gimmicks, unrealistic cuts and â€œrosy assumptionsâ€?of economic growth that would reach 3 percent annually by the end of Trumpâ€™s first term.  The Congressional Budget Office projects the economy to grow at an annual pace of 1.9 percent over that period.  The White House said its proposed tax cuts would help fuel higher growth and pay for themselves by generating an additional $2 trillion in revenue over 10 years. Lawrence Summers, a former economic adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration was double-counting that money by saying it would help close budget deficits while also offsetting the revenue lost by cutting tax rates.  â€œIt appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly 40 years I have been tracking them,â€?Summers wrote in the Washington Post. Mick Mulvaney, Trumpâ€™s budget office director, said his office made other assumptions that were probably too conservative. â€œWe stand by the numbers,â€?he said. Federal aid to states would shrink by 3 percent, though the cuts would fall most heavily on states that backed Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. States that voted for Clinton would collectively face a drop of 4.8 percent, while those that backed Trump would see assistance cut by 1.2 percent. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2qhwnLV) There is some new spending in Trumpâ€™s plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October.       The Pentagon would get a spending hike, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, which was a central promise of Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign.     Trumpâ€™s proposal foresees selling half of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. The announcement surprised oil markets and briefly pulled down U.S. crude prices.    Republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the Trump administrationâ€™s economic agenda.     But the effort has stalled as the White House grapples with the political fallout from allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Mulvaney said the plan is the first one in a long time to pay attention to taxpayers. â€œYou have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it,â€?he told reporters. Republican leaders in the House said lawmakers would be able to find common ground with the budget plan. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran a populist campaign during the Democratic presidential primary, said the budget showed that Trumpâ€™s campaign promises to stand up for working people was â€œjust cheap and dishonest campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes,â€?Sanders told a news conference. While the plan boosts defense spending by $54 billion, it falls short of campaign promises for a â€œhistoricâ€?hike in military spending amid plans to rebuild the U.S. Navy. That is only 3 percent more than former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The president would reduce nearly a third of funding for diplomacy and foreign aid including global health and food aid, peacekeeping and other forms of non-military foreign involvement. â€œIf we implemented this budget, youâ€™d have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk,â€?said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. â€œThis budget is not going to go anywhere.â€?Trump upheld his promise - for the most part - that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security, two expensive safety-net programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. Those programs may not come out of Capitol Hill unscathed, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. The White House proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, to work. Most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the budget plan will boost economic growth by fostering capital investment and creating jobs for workers who gave up their job hunts during tough times.

0156,Ariana Grande returns to U.S. following Manchester bombing,"(Reuters) - Ariana Grande returned to the United States on Tuesday, one day after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at the singerâ€™s concert in Manchester, England, as questions lingered over whether she would continue her European tour. Grande, 23, was seen in photographs posted on the Daily Mail website walking down the steps of a private plane at an airport in her hometown of Boca Raton, Florida, and being met by family members. The Daily Mail images showed the diminutive pop star dressed casually in sweats and appearing downcast as she greeted her boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, on the tarmac and getting into a waiting car. Grande had not been seen publicly since an explosion ripped through the packed Manchester Arena at the end of her performance there. Some of the 22 people who died in the attack were teens or young girls. Grande was apparently unharmed. British police have identified the man suspected of carrying out the massacre as 22-year-old Salman Abedi, who was born in Manchester to parents of Libyan origin. Islamic State claimed responsibility for what it called revenge against â€œCrusaders,â€?but there appeared to be contradictions in its account of the operation. In her only statement so far, Grande took to Twitter some five hours after the bombing to describe herself as â€œbrokenâ€?in the aftermath of the attack. â€œfrom the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i donâ€™t have words,â€?she said in the tweet. Grande was performing in Manchester during the European leg of a tour to promote her third album, â€œDangerous Woman,â€?which  also has her scheduled to visit London, Belgium, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and France in the coming weeks. Despite speculation that she would cancel the rest of the tour, no formal announcement had been made as of Tuesday.  Grandeâ€™s manager, Scooter Braun, did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters. â€œWe mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act,â€?Braun said in a statement posted on Twitter on Monday evening. â€œWe ask all of you to hold the victims, their families and all those affected in your hearts and prayers.â€?Grande, a native of Boca Raton, starred in the Broadway musical â€?3â€?and on the Nickelodeon TV series â€œVictoriousâ€?before releasing her solo debut album, â€œYours Truly.â€? Best known for her singles â€œProblemâ€?and â€œBreak Free,â€?Grande is credited with having an exceptionally broad vocal range for a pop star. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0157,Ex-CIA chief: Worries grew of Trump campaign contacts to Russia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former CIA director John Brennan said on Tuesday he had noticed contacts between associates of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 election and grew concerned Moscow had sought to lure Americans down â€œa treasonous path.â€?Brennan, who headed the agency until Trump became president in January, also told a congressional hearing that he personally warned the head of Russiaâ€™s FSB security service in a phone call last August that meddling in the election would hurt relations with the United States. Separately, the top U.S. intelligence official, Dan Coats, sidestepped a question on a Washington Post report that Trump had asked him and the National Security Agency chief to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did say he has made clear to Trumpâ€™s administration that â€œany political shapingâ€?of intelligence would be inappropriate. The comments by Brennan and Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, added fuel to a controversy that has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago amid the agencyâ€™s investigation into possible collusion between people associated with his presidential campaign and Russia. â€œI encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign,â€?Brennanâ€™s said in testimony to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Brennan said that he cannot say definitively there was actual collusion. Brennanâ€™s testimony was the first public confirmation of the worry at high levels of the U.S. government last year over suspicious contacts between Trump campaign associates and Moscow. It was also the most complete account to date of the CIAâ€™s thinking at a time when intelligence agencies were putting together evidence that Russia was interfering in the heated U.S. presidential race to help businessman Trump, a Republican, defeat Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Comey was heading the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Russian interference and possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign, leading to accusations by Trump critics that he has sought to curtail the FBI inquiry. In another development, Trump has retained Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer who has represented Trump in the past, as his private attorney for special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into the Russia matter, a Fox Business Network reporter said on Twitter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in Trumpâ€™s favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegation. Trump has denied any collusion but the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. â€œIt should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so,â€?Brennan said. Brennan said he worried that Russians tried to recruit Americans during the presidential campaign to work for Moscow. Brennan said it was possible for someone to be helpful to the Russian cause without realizing it. â€œThey (the Russians) try to suborn individuals and they try to get individuals, including U.S. persons, to act on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly,â€?he said, adding that â€œindividuals going on a treasonous path often do not realize it until it is too late.â€?Republican Representative Trey Gowdy asked Brennan: â€œDid you see evidence of collusion, coordination and conspiracy between Donald Trump and Russian state actors?â€?â€œI saw information and intelligence that was worthy of investigation by the bureau (FBI) to determine whether or not such cooperation or collusion was taking place,â€?Brennan replied, but declined to elaborate. Reuters reported last week that Trumpâ€™s fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn and other advisers to Trumpâ€™s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. Flynn was forced out in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Brennan said he believed he was the first U.S. official to raise the matter of election interference with the Russians, citing an Aug. 4, 2016 phone call he had with the head of Russiaâ€™s FSB, Alexander Bortnikov. He said he raised media reports of Russian attempts to meddle in the election with Bortnikov, who denied any involvement by Moscow, and told him if Russia pursued this course it would destroy prospects for improved U.S.-Russia relations. Trumpâ€™s public approval ratings dropped to a new low in Reuters/Ipsos poll data released on Tuesday, with 37 percent of U.S. adults surveyed approving of the president while 57 percent disapproving. Support for Trump appears to have dropped among Americans of all political stripes. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Coats sidestepped questions about a Washington Post report that Trump had asked Coats and Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, to help him knock down the notion that there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did not deny Trump had made such a request. Coats said that â€œI donâ€™t feel itâ€™s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president.â€?The Post reported Coats and Rogers declined the request. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Coats that the fact he had not denied the Post report should lead to â€œeven more intensive investigation of the alleged effort by the president to enlist you in shutting down, or stifling that investigation.â€?â€œThis evidence, if true, goes to criminal intent and constitutes mounting evidence of obstruction of justice,â€?Blumenthal added. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said they will subpoena two of Flynnâ€™s businesses after he declined to comply with a subpoena for documents in the panelâ€™s Russia probe.

0158,White House says no evidence of Trump team collusion with Russians,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House, responding to hearings on Capitol Hill about contacts between officials in Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia, said on Tuesday there was no evidence of collusion between Trumpâ€™s team and Moscow. Testifying before a House panel, former CIA director John Brennan said he was aware of contacts between Russian officials and people involved in the Trump campaign and grew concerned that Moscow had sought to lure Americans down â€œa treasonous path.â€?Dan Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, was questioned in separate testimony before a Senate panel over a report in the Washington Post that Trump asked Coats to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of collusion. Coats sidestepped the question but said he has made clear to Trumpâ€™s administration that â€œany political shapingâ€?of intelligence would be inappropriate. In a statement to reporters, a White House official said the hearings showed â€œthere is still no evidence of any Russia-Trump campaign collusion.â€?Trump, who is in Rome on his first overseas trip as president, has been embroiled in controversy since his firing earlier this month of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey amid the agencyâ€™s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

0159,"Illinois Senate Democrats pass budget plan, hurdles seen in House","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers in the Illinois Senate on Tuesday voted in favor of a budget and tax package that includes hikes to income and sales taxes in a go-it-alone effort to break the stateâ€™s long-running budget impasse eight days before the end of the legislative session. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of its second straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to gridlock between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the state legislature. The development is not necessarily a breakthrough, however, as the House remains non-committal on the measures and Rauner has said he will not support them without certain conditions. The package of revenue and appropriations bills would raise income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent. The income tax hike would generate an estimated $4.4 billion annually and the corporate income tax increase would generate around $514 million annually, according to figures provided by Illinoisâ€?Senate Democrats. The budget measure allocates $37.3 billion in spending from the stateâ€™s General Revenue Fund, a figure that matches the one proposed by Rauner. The balanced budget removes a $405 million in previously proposed cuts to Medicaid.  â€œIt is time for us to save the state,â€?Democratic state Senator Toi Hutchinson said on the Senate floor on Tuesday before the votes.  The bills now move to the Democrat-controlled House where it is unclear if they will garner enough support.  The measures would be â€œthoughtfully considered,â€?Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement on Tuesday evening.  Holding the bills from the House until after May 31, the final day of the legislature, triggers a supermajority requirement, which means Republicans would have to approve them in order to advance the bills to Rauner. But Rauner and other Republicans said on Tuesday they would not support the bills because they do not address property tax relief.  â€œLet me be clear, to get my signature, any agreement must include real property tax relief,â€?Rauner said on Twitter. Illinois, the countryâ€™s fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history due in large part because of its ongoing fiscal woes.   The stateâ€™s backlog of unpaid bills hit nearly $14.4 billion on Tuesday, according to the state comptrollerâ€™s office. Rauner is also facing a number of high-profile Democratic challengers in next yearâ€™s election.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0160,Trump budget cuts may stir backlash in rural America,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposals to slash federal aid to the poor, the sick and people living in rural areas reflect conservativesâ€?demands for a smaller federal government but target many of the very people who voted for him last November. In his first detailed budget submission to Congress on Tuesday, Trump requested major reductions to programs that help poor families afford groceries and poor and disabled people get healthcare.  Job training for unemployed coal miners would be threatened and drug treatment programs would face cuts at a time when heroin and prescription pill addictions are tearing at rural America. Subsidies for commercial air travel in rural areas would be cut by more than half. The White House said many of the proposed cuts were aimed at ineffective programs and that the savings were needed to help balance the budget in 10 years and finance increased spending for defense and other programs. Some Republicans in Congress cheered Trumpâ€™s budget. Representative Mark Meadows, who heads the House of Representativesâ€?hard-right Freedom Caucus, called it â€œa great step forwardâ€?for conservatives, adding: â€œItâ€™s all about economic growth.â€? But many other Republican lawmakers, seeing a budget they think will be tough to sell back home, greeted it warily. â€œThese cuts that are being proposed are draconian. Theyâ€™re not mere savings. Theyâ€™re really deep, deep cuts,â€?said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, whose eastern Kentucky  district relies heavily on federal aid. Trump trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election in Kentucky, 63 percent to 33 percent, winning every region except the urban Louisville and Lexington areas. Rogers, a 36-year congressman, said the Republican president remained popular in his district, but added: â€œWe have not yet had a chance to see how (voters) will react to his budget proposals.â€?It is unclear if the Republican-controlled House and Senate will be able to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Democratic votes would also likely be needed to pass the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to carry out budget priorities. But the proposed reductions could trigger a backlash for Republicans, complicating efforts to keep control of the U.S. Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trumpâ€™s own base of political support also could be undermined. Republican Representative Tom Cole, who represents an Oklahoma district that the Almanac of American Politics described as â€œcountrified,â€?predicted â€œCongress would look at some of those things differentlyâ€?from the Trump administrationâ€™s budget. Cole oversees spending on health and social welfare programs as chairman of a House Appropriations panel and has a medical research facility important to his district that relies on federal funding. â€œThe National Institutes of Health is not likely to be cut. I think CDC (Centers for Disease Control) is not likely to be cut. I think that is ill-advised personally,â€?Cole told reporters. Atop Rogersâ€?list of worries is Trumpâ€™s proposed elimination of the $146 million Appalachian Regional Commission that has helped bring projects such as job training to unemployed coal miners, a broadband technology center to Kentucky and high-tech medical equipment to impoverished regions. The food stamp program, which helps low-income and disabled people buy groceries, would be reduced by $200 billion over 10 years. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, bedrock Republican states that Trump won have long food-stamp rolls: 3.8 million people in Texas, 682,077 in Vice President Mike Penceâ€™s home state of Indiana, 815,000 in Alabama and 1.6 million in Georgia, for example. Trump got broad support in last Novemberâ€™s election in counties with high numbers of white voters who receive food stamps. He was victorious in 991 of the 1,093 counties studied by the U.S. Census Bureau where the percentage of white households receiving food stamps exceeds the national average. Overall, according to a Reuters analysis, states would see federal aid shrink under the proposals by 3 percent in the next fiscal year, with cuts falling more heavily on states that voted for Clinton. States that voted for Trump would see federal aid decline by 1.2 percent, while those that supported Clinton would collectively see a drop of 4.8 percent. Liberal California would be hit hardest, with a 9.8 percent drop. Kentucky, a conservative state that signed on to the Affordable Care Actâ€™s Medicaid expansion, would also be hit hard, with assistance dropping by 9.7 percent.  Some Republican lawmakers welcomed the budget cuts. â€œI think weâ€™re way over in the number of people who have been able to qualify for food stamps,â€?said John Carter, who represents a central Texas district. Trumpâ€™s proposed budget cuts would help pay for a 10 percent buildup in defense spending for next year, and help finance a wall on the southwest border that Trump previously had promised would be paid for by Mexico, something the Mexican government has adamantly said it will not do. The Medicaid healthcare plan for the poor is slated for about an $800 billion cut, reversing the expansion that former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, brought to Republican states like West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky with large populations of poor people. â€œMost of the (budget) cuts will focus on programs for low- income folks and public investments,â€?said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which pushes for long-term fixes to Washingtonâ€™s debt problems. Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by billionaire Charles Koch, applauded Trumpâ€™s call to balance the budget within 10 years, cut taxes and roll back regulations - moves he said would stimulate job growth. â€œIt sends all of the right signals for the first time in nearly a decade - a budget that actually is focused on the best interests of the American taxpayer rather than whatâ€™s popular in Washington,â€?he said.

0161,Republicans push back against Trump plan to cut foreign aid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans in Congress on Tuesday assailed his proposed cuts in the diplomatic and foreign aid budget, making it unlikely the cutbacks in global health, peacekeeping and other programs will take effect. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for diplomacy and foreign aid spending, said Trumpâ€™s proposal to cut the diplomacy and aid budget by one third would â€œgut soft power.â€?â€œIf we implemented this budget, youâ€™d have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk,â€?Graham told reporters. â€œThis budget is not going to go anywhere.â€?Congress sets the federal government budget, and Republicans who control both houses and Democrats have said they do not support such drastic cuts.  The funding cuts in Trumpâ€™s plan for the fiscal year beginning in October would mark a stark decrease in non-military U.S. government engagement abroad as the administration pursues Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?world view. Trump administration officials defend the cuts by saying  the rest of the world must do its â€œfair shareâ€?as the United States retreats from its traditional spending abroad. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Trumpâ€™s budget would cut U.S. funding for global health programs including efforts focusing on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by about one quarter, to about $6.5 billion for 2018. The budget proposal envisions cuts to the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, a cornerstone of U.S. global health assistance, which supports HIV/AIDS treatment, testing and counseling for millions of people worldwide. Under Trumpâ€™s budget, PEPFAR funding would be $5 billion per year compared to about $6 billion annually now, the State Department said.  No patient currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, a treatment for HIV, through PEPFAR funds will lose that treatment, officials said. The budget proposal also includes a steep cut to funding for international organizations, without specifying which groups might lose their funding. The NATO military alliance would continue to be fully funded. U.S. funding for international peacekeeping would fall to about $1.5 billion, a cut of over 50 percent from 2017 levels.  The United States is the biggest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget â€œGiven the growing threats we face, we should be supporting â€?not slashing â€?anti-terrorism, law enforcement, and humanitarian programs,â€?Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.  Trumpâ€™s budget would reduce funding for educational and cultural exchanges by 52 percent, including a 47 percent cut to the Fulbright Program, which enables U.S. citizens to go abroad and brings foreign students to study in the United States. The Trump proposal assumes the State Department will maintain its current structure, though Tillerson has said he wants to restructure the agency and find efficiencies. Nonetheless, the budget makes major shifts in some funding.  A core, $2.8 billion development account overseen by USAID that funds agricultural, water, sanitation and other projects would be consolidated with other funding streams to create the Economic Support and Development Fund. That new account would then be cut by about 45 percent compared to current funding levels. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0162,Senate panel says it will subpoena Michael Flynn businesses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday they would subpoena two of former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s businesses after Flynn declined to comply with a subpoena for documents in the panelâ€™s Russia probe. â€œWhile we disagree with General Flynnâ€™s lawyersâ€?interpretation of taking the Fifth ... itâ€™s even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the Fifth,â€?the panelâ€™s vice chairman, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, told reporters, referring to Flynnâ€™s decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The committee issued a subpoena for Flynn to provide documents related to its investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Flynnâ€™s attorney said on Monday he declined to comply. Flynn is considered a key witness in the investigation, because of his ties to Russia. He was forced to resign from his position at the White House in February, after less than a month on the job, for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Warner and the panelâ€™s chairman, Republican Richard Burr, said the committee would take three actions in response to Flynnâ€™s refusal to respond to their subpoena, the two subpoenas to his businesses, and a letter to Flynnâ€™s attorney pushing back against his refusal to comply. â€œWeâ€™re taking options that we feel are appropriate right now,â€?Burr told reporters after a closed committee meeting. Burr said a possible contempt of Congress action was a possibility, but not until other measures were exhausted. â€œThatâ€™s not our preference today. We would like to hear from General Flynn. We would like to see his documents,â€?Burr said. â€œWe would like him to tell his story because he publicly said: â€˜Iâ€™ve got a story to tell.â€?Weâ€™re allowing him that opportunity to tell it.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0163,U.S. defense budget proposal sees modest increase despite hawkish rhetoric,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s budget proposal for national defense increases spending, it falls short of campaign promises to rebuild the Navy and a â€œhistoricâ€?increase in military spending. The budget proposes a modest increase in military spending. Trump is seeking a $52 billion hike for the Pentagon as part of an overall defense spending increase of $54 billion. That is almost 10 percent higher than current budget caps, but only 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $603 billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense programs as well as the Department of Defense. The Pentagonâ€™s specific defense request is for $574.5 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the budget for fiscal year 2017. â€œLooking at defense specifically, this is not a historic budget - much less a buildup,â€?said Mackenzie Eaglen, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank based in Washington. â€œThis budget seeks to repair the cracked military foundation by plugging gaps and filling holes,â€?she said.  At the direction of Defense Secretary James Mattis, the Pentagon is carrying out a broad budget and strategy review, and experts said this budget is more of a placeholder until that is complete.  â€œIt feels to me like the Trump administration just doesnâ€™t really have it all together at this point,â€?said Laicie Heeley, a fellow at the Stimson Center, another Washington-based think tank. The budget request must be passed by Congress but faces skeptical lawmakers. U.S. officials said the focus of the budget proposal was to improve readiness.  U.S. Senator John McCain, one of the leading military and foreign policy voices in Congress, said on Tuesday that the White Houseâ€™s budget proposal was â€œinadequateâ€?and â€œdead on arrivalâ€?in Congress.  McCain has been a proponent of increasing base defense spending to above $640 billion in order to renew the military and invest in modern capabilities. â€œObviously it is going to take a lot in Congress, in both the House and Senate, to try to get it done and we are here to help in any way we can,â€?Acting Comptroller John Roth told reporters. The proposal includes an additional $65 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) money, which is intended to fund ongoing wars and does not count against the budget caps. The fiscal 2018 budget proposalâ€™s OCO funding includes $46 billion for operations in Afghanistan, but is based on current U.S. troops levels at about 8,400. The Trump administration is weighing sending between 3,000 and 5,000 additional U.S. and coalition troops to the war-torn country to stem gains made by Taliban militants. The OCO fund also includes $13 billion for the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and $4.8 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative, which is an increase of about $1.4 billion from the 2017 request. The budget proposes $137.2 billion for the Army, which is looking to keep active-duty troop levels at 476,000. The Obama administration had planned for the number of Army active-duty troops to go down to 450,000 by the end of fiscal 2017.    The White Houseâ€™s proposal also earmarks a total of $171.5 billion for the Navy. As a presidential candidate, Trump made repeated calls to expand the current 275-ship fleet to 350. However, that will have to wait because the budget proposal did not accelerate the Navyâ€™s schedule for purchasing additional ships, but instead increased funding for ship maintenance as the duration of overseas deployments increases.  The Navy added a Boeing Co P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft, but delayed the purchase of two F-35C variant jets made by Lockheed Martin Co. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0164,"U.S. budget proposes allowing new toll roads, higher airline security fees","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants to allow states to expand the use of tolling on interstate highways while sharply cutting grants for transit projects and raising airline passenger security fees, according to the White House budget released on Tuesday. The overall budget proposal is $76 billion, which the administration said is about the same as for 2016. About $60 billion of that is annual â€œmandatory spending,â€?including road repairs paid through gas tax collections. The Transportation Departmentâ€™s â€œdiscretionaryâ€?budget is being cut by 12.7 percent, or $2.4 billion to $16.2 billion. The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told reporters local communities know best what projects they need. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the budget cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several Cabinet departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. Schumer said the administration would cut funds from states and cities â€œto pay wealthy hedge funds and Wall Street to build more toll roads.â€?Chao said Schumer has called for $1 trillion in direct government funding, which is â€œnot very realisticâ€?and would add to the deficit. Administration officials said they expect that by 2022 there will be a new mechanism to make up for lost revenue. The budget projects a $15 billion reduction in funding in 2023 and does not include any funding to make up for that. Congress has been adding tens of billions of dollars annually to pay for crumbling roads because gas tax revenue is not keeping up with repair needs. The administration also proposes to allow for private companies to construct and operate highway rest stops. It also wants to raise the airline passenger security fee by $1 to $6.60 per one-way trip, which would generate $530 million for the Transportation Safety Administration. The budget would end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, cutting $630 million of the $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. The Trump budget would eliminate the Obama administrationâ€™s TIGER grant program, saving $5 billion over 10 years in the program that has funded transit projects. It also would cut $18 billion out of another government transit grant program called New Starts. The administration also proposes to privatize the nationâ€™s air traffic control system, which budget documents suggest would boost the budget deficit by about $45 billion over 10 years.

0165,"Trump proposes deep U.S. spending cuts in Mexico, Central America","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed drastically slashing U.S. foreign aid spending in Mexico and Central America, which are struggling with drug violence, graft and poverty that prompts many from the troubled region to migrate north. Trumpâ€™s austere 2018 budget proposal, which seeks to trim $3.6 trillion from government spending over the next decade and is unlikely to get legislative approval in its current form, envisages steep cuts in most federal departments, but particularly the State Department. Ever since launching his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has attacked Mexico, threatening to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, build a Mexico-funded southern border wall and ramp up deportations of those living without documents in the United States.  Tuesdayâ€™s proposal foresees 2018 Mexican aid of $87.66 million, down more than 45 percent from the 2016 outlay. The proposed spending cuts comes as the United States leans on Mexico to do more to prop up its poor Central American neighbors, where poverty and gangs are the main drivers pushing migrants to the United States. The budget proposes scrapping most U.S. money for the Mexican military, along with counterterrorism funds and some governance programs. Narcotics and law enforcement spending would fall from $100 million in 2016 to $60 million. In Guatemala, U.S. aid would drop almost 40 percent from 2016, to $80.66 million, while in Honduras and El Salvador it would fall nearly a third. In a call with reporters, U.S. officials stressed the cuts would not prevent them from tackling their regional objectives.  â€œThat is a reduction. However it really prioritizes our programs that focus on disrupting the activities of transnational criminal organizations, strengthening border security and combating corruption â€?weâ€™re going to continue addressing those root causes as part of our Central America strategy,â€?an official said. Mexico, which is struggling with rising crime, will be co-hosting a June meeting in Miami where the U.S. government hopes to drum up more private sector support to improve employment and security conditions in Central America. Although the number of migrants arriving on the southern U.S. border has fallen drastically since Trump took office, history suggests the decline may prove short-lived if he fails to realize his tough policies. Well over 100,000 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since 2006, and the 2017 murder tally could be the highest ever as legacy drug cartels splinter into ever more violent factions.

0166,U.S. farm groups oppose Trump's cuts to agriculture spending,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farm groups on Tuesday pushed back against President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal to slash agriculture spending, viewing it as a fresh threat to a struggling farm economy. The White House on Monday proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal government funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years, including limits on federal subsidies for crop insurance premiums. Congress has the final say on the governmentâ€™s budget and lawmakers said the presidentâ€™s plan stands little chance of passing. U.S. Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue said there was no â€œsugarcoatingâ€?the budget proposal, which could lead to the elimination of 5,263 jobs at the department if implemented, or about 5 percent of its workforce. USDA requested $18 billion for department spending in fiscal 2018, down from $24 billion in 2017. Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland overwhelmingly supported Trump last November and are struggling with low crop prices that are hurting incomes. â€œThis budget seems to really go after the people that got the president elected,â€?said Zack Clark, director of government relations for the National Farmers Union. Some of the biggest proposed cuts come from changes to the crop insurance system, which many farmers rely on to keep their operations running. â€œItâ€™s clear that this budget was written without input from farmers who would be severely affected,â€?Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement.  But changes in crop insurance that cause farmers to cut back on plantings could provide relief to a global balance sheet heavy with supplies. Falling production could pay off in the long run by helping to lift prices, said Scott Irwin, agricultural economist for the University of Illinois. Trumpâ€™s budget imposes a $40,000 limit on crop insurance premium subsidies, which could prevent some farmers from insuring their entire acreage. There is currently no limit. Typically, farmers pay a portion of their insurance premiums and USDA covers the rest, said Jeff Harrison, a lawyer who represents the Crop Insurance Professionals Association.Â  â€œIn practical terms, youâ€™re really going after full-time farm families.â€? U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said she would oppose the cuts, which â€œwould leave our farmers, families, and rural communities vulnerable in tough times.â€? House Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, both Republicans, said they â€œwill fight to ensure farmers have a strong safety net.â€?

0167,"In U.S. presidential first, Trump prays at Jerusalem's Western Wall","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a historic visit to Jerusalemâ€™s Western Wall on Monday, standing before the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray and saying a few words before inserting a note between the monumental stones. He was accompanied by the Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz, who said on Israel Radio that he recited two psalms with the U.S. leader. One of them, Psalm 122, speaks of Jerusalem as a â€œcity that is united togetherâ€? The ancient stones are in a part of Jerusalem that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital, a status that is not recognized internationally. â€?Trump) said that he understands the significance of the Western Wall for the Jewish people and thatâ€™s why he decided to visit here during his first trip to Israel. He is certain he will come here again, perhaps many times. He was very moved,â€?Rabinowitz said. â€œHe asked about the size of the Western Wall. We presented the maps, what was in the past, whatâ€™s happening now, the excavations, the finds.â€?The president was joined on the visit by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who went to the wall shortly after Trump and said prayers. Both he and Trump wore black kippahs, the skull caps worn by religious Jews and by others as a mark of respect.  After a few moments standing silently before the limestone edifice, his right hand resting on the blocks, Trump withdrew and smiled briefly. He did not walk backwards from the wall as religious Jews do as a sign of devotion. It is the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited and prayed at the site. Barack Obama visited in 2008, but it was during the campaign, before he became president. The Wall, the visible portion of which stands more than 60 feet (20 meters) high, was a retaining structure for the second Jewish temple, which stood on an esplanade in the Old City before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. The site is known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism, and to Muslims as The Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the gold-topped Dome of the Rock, now stand. Access to much of the walled Old City, which is divided into four â€˜quartersâ€?â€?Muslim, Christian, Armenian and Jewish â€?was shut down on Monday ahead of Trumpâ€™s visit. The area has been the scene of multiple stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Jews over the past couple of years.  As Trump and Kushner visited the area of the wall set aside for men, Melania Trump and Ivanka, Kushnerâ€™s wife, visited a separate nearby section where women are allowed to pray.  Like her husband, Melania held her right hand up against the towering stones and inserted a note among the cracks, something Jews often do as a means of submitting prayers. Ivanka, who converted to Judaism on marrying her husband, was dressed demurely in black and wore her hair partially covered by a small hat. Video footage showed her crying as she prayed at the wall. Trumpâ€™s visit to the site sparked some controversy during the planning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had sought to accompany Trump to the Western Wall. But the State Department said that would not be permitted as officially the Wall is in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied 50 years ago, and Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state.

0168,Texas House passes 'bathroom bill' targeting public schools," (This version of the May 22 story was corrected to clarify details of the bill in paragraph four to show that it requires schools to provide alternative facilities) By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Texas House of Representatives gave formal approval on Monday to a bill that would restrict bathroom access for transgender students in public schools, a measure that critics say promotes discrimination against such children. The stateâ€™s Republican-controlled legislature has been at the forefront in advancing measures seen by backers as protecting traditional values and religious liberty but criticized by civil rights groups as eroding protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, people. The Texas House gave preliminary approval on Sunday night to the bill, which requires public school students to use bathrooms, changing facilities and locker rooms that match their biological sex, not the gender with which they identify. Under the bill, school districts have to accommodate students who do not wish to use a common facility based on biological sex with a single-occupancy facility, or a multi-occupancy facility if its use occurs when no one else is present. The measure is narrower in scope than a bathroom bill passed along mostly party lines by the state Senate in March that extended to state universities and public buildings. The Senate bill is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina. The North Carolina law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events, and was later revamped in the face of criticism. The more limited House measure is seen as a way to avoid an economic backlash in Texas, analysts said. â€œIt is absolutely about child safety,â€?Republican state Representative Chris Paddie, who managed the bill, said in House debate on Sunday. The measure heads back to the Senate for consideration of changes made since it was in that chamber. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said he supports a bathroom bill. Critics said the House and Senate versions undermined civil rights and used children as political pawns. â€œThere is no moral middle ground on discrimination, â€?said Kathy Miller, president of the civil liberties advocacy group  Texas Freedom Network. The legislature on Monday also sent to the governor a bill allowing adoption agencies to reject families on religious grounds, an action slammed by critics as discriminatory against LGBT Texans and non-Christians. LGBT rights groups said they would challenge the adoption bill in court if it became law, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state.  The billâ€™s backers, which include several Christian groups, said it banned no one and had a mechanism for the state government to offer alternative adoption providers if any service is denied for religious beliefs.

0169,Leader of moderate Republican House group resigns over healthcare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the leaders of the moderate Republican â€œTuesday Groupâ€?in the U.S. House of Representatives resigned as co-chairman on Tuesday, citing divisions over efforts to overhaul the nationâ€™s healthcare system. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told group members during a weekly meeting he was stepping down in the wake of efforts to repeal and replace Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s healthcare law. â€œDuring efforts to reform our healthcare system, I worked with many in the Tuesday Group towards a real solution that would protect the most vulnerable among us, while driving down healthcare costs,â€?MacArthur said in prepared remarks reviewed by Reuters. â€œThat being said, itâ€™s clear that some in the Tuesday Group have different objectives and a different sense of governing than I do,â€?he added. MacArthur could not be reached immediately for comment. MacArthur said more than half of the Republican â€œnoâ€?votes for the Houseâ€™s Obamacare replacement legislation came from Tuesday Group members. He called the groupâ€™s inability to come together on healthcare a â€œnon-starterâ€?and said it had become clear that some members of the group had different objectives and would prefer a different leader.  MacArthur authored an amendment that helped Republican leaders in the House earlier this month pass the American Health Care Act, which would repeal and replace much of Obamacare. His amendment would allow states to apply for waivers so they could opt out of some Obamacare requirements, including one of the lawâ€™s most popular provisions that prohibit insurers from charging more to individuals with pre-existing conditions.   MacArthurâ€™s amendment brought members of the conservative Freedom Caucus on board to support the bill. Tuesday Group members, however, complained they had not been consulted ahead of time. Some criticized it as a departure from what they wanted to see in the healthcare package. MacArthur will remain a member of the Tuesday Group after resigning from its leadership, website Politico reported.  â€œClearly, our group is divided. Many in the Tuesday Group are eager to live up to our ideal of being problem-solvers, while others seem unwilling to compromise. The recent healthcare debate was illustrative,â€?MacArthur said in his prepared remarks. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0170,U.S. derivatives regulator splits with White House over budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. derivatives regulator pushed back against White House efforts on Tuesday to rein in its fiscal 2018 budgets, saying it needs additional resources to carry out its mission to monitor the marketplace and analyze rules. In a somewhat unusual move, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Tuesday it is seeking a $31.5 million boost on its current $250 million budget.   The White House, by contrast, proposed to keep the budgets of both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission flat.  The SECâ€™s current budget is $1.6 billion.  The White House also said it would support allotting an additional $244.5 million to help pay for a new SEC headquarters if it must relocate after its lease expires, though at the same time it called on Congress to kill a $50 million reserve fund in fiscal year 2019 that the agency uses to fund long-term information technology projects. The SEC concurred with the White Houseâ€™s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, and said it intends to continue making use of the reserve fund, which it called â€œcritically importantâ€?to help it keep pace with rapidly changing technology.  A document released by the agency did not weigh in on whether the fund should be eliminated by 2019, as the White House proposes. The CFTC won broad new powers from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to police the massive over-the-counter derivatives marketplace.  However, it has often struggled to convince the Republican-led Congress to boost its resources. The CFTC said Tuesday that it has independent legal authority to seek a different budget from what the White House proposes, and that its pitch to Congress was approved by its two commissioners, Republican Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and Democrat Sharon Bowen. The money would be used to devote more resources to analyze the economic costs and benefits of its rules, boost compliance examinations of clearing houses that help reduce counterparty trading risks, and further advance its newly unveiled financial technology initiatives. â€œThe U.S. derivatives markets should be neither the most regulated nor the least regulated of the world - but the best regulated,â€?Giancarlo wrote in a letter to congressional appropriators. â€œThis budget request ensures that the CFTC can meet such a standard before the American people.â€?Bowen said while she voted to request more money she does not support the proposal because it does not go far enough to provide the CFTC with adequate funding. Although the CFTC and the White House disagreed on the number, both the SEC and CFTC largely came out unscathed in the budget, which overall calls for slashing $3.6 trillion in spending.

0171,Trump budget would sell entire U.S. Northeast gasoline reserve,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration is proposing to sell off in the coming fiscal year the entire gasoline reserve created in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to its budget proposal unveiled on Tuesday. The U.S. Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR) was established in 2014 to minimize the impact of sudden supply interruptions, such as occurred in 2012 during Sandy, the second-costliest hurricane in the countryâ€™s history. The gasoline reserve was established as part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). It consists of 1 million barrels of gasoline blendstock and is stored in commercial storage terminals in Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  â€œThe NGSR has not been utilized and does not have the operational functionality that was envisioned post-Sandy,â€?the budget proposal said. It noted that the NGSRâ€™s leased commercial storage contracts expire in the early part of fiscal 2019. A sale would offset $69 million of discretionary spending, with any additional proceeds going to the U.S. Treasuryâ€™s general fund for deficit reduction, the proposal says.  Sandy battered the northeastern U.S. coast at the end of October 2012, destroying homes and buildings, closing refineries and disrupting gasoline supplies. The U.S. East Coast accounts for over a third of national gasoline consumption.  The gasoline market is not likely to be affected significantly if the budget proposal is approved in its current form by Congress, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products markets at consultancy Energy Aspects, but it would leave the region at risk if another disaster struck. â€œNothing has changed very much (since 2012)... if we were to get in a situation where we once again have refinery closures on the East Coast, it would be a much more vulnerable market,â€?he said. The budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 also calls for selling half of the 688 million barrels of oil in the SPR, the nationâ€™s emergency crude stockpile. That would represent about 141 days of U.S. oil imports of oil but only about three days worth of global production. â€œIn some ways it seems more logical now to have a gasoline reserve than a separate crude reserve,â€?said David Thompson, executive vice president at energy-specialized commodities broker Powerhouse in Washington. â€œThere is a time component involved in making and distributing gasoline, so if the Northeast refineries or the Colonial (pipeline) were affected by a major incident, it would take time to develop an alternative supply chain,â€?he said. Traders also said the gasoline reserve had been created so recently that its liquidation was unlikely to be approved by lawmakers quickly.  Under the Trump budget proposal, the existing Northeast home heating oil reserve of 1 million barrels would continue to operate. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0172,White House budget envisions massive savings from Dodd-Frank rollback,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed budget estimates that the federal government could save $35 billion over the next decade by rolling back regulations governing Wall Street. The White House does not detail how those savings, which are equivalent to the annual economic output of the Democratic Republic of Congo, would be realized. But the administration said an ongoing review of existing financial rules â€œwill likely result in proposals that will provide significant savings to the federal government.â€?While it is not expected to be passed by Congress, the fiscal 2018 budget unveiled by the White House on Tuesday hews closely to Trumpâ€™s view that slashing financial regulations  would boost the economy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the impact of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. An initial report recommending policy changes is expected to come at the beginning of June. The White Houseâ€™s projected savings from easing financial rules exceed estimates offered by the Congressional Budget Office. That policy scorekeeper calculated that $24 billion would be saved over a decade if a broad Dodd-Frank rollback bill currently in the House of Representatives were passed.  Most of those savings identified by CBO come from eliminating a Dodd-Frank provision allowing the government to step in and wind down failing financial institutions, and by placing tighter control over the funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was set up to protect consumers from predatory lending. Trumpâ€™s budget would give control of funding that agency to Congress, a policy change sought by Republicans eager to rein it in. Currently, the CFPB gets its funding from the Federal Reserve. The White House estimates that moving oversight of the CFPB to Congress would save the federal government $6.8 billion over a decade. However, the budget proposal does not account for any funds appropriated to the CFPB beyond fiscal 2018. The Office of Financial Research, also created by Dodd-Frank to gather data on financial markets, is facing a 28 percent budget cut under the new plan. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would see their budgets hold steady at $250 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, under the new budget. The CFTC is pushing for an additional $31 million in funding in its own budget request. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0173,"CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax. Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal. The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.  Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.  â€œUnder the new border adjustment tax, American families â€?your constituents â€?would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less,â€?Cornell told the committee.  Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive. â€œA competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad,â€?he said. The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous, especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it. Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports. Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform. The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure. â€œWe will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution,â€?Simon said. Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax. Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.  â€œThis is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime,â€?she said.

0174,"Amid opposition, Trump makes low budget request for Mexico border wall","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is asking Congress for $1.6 billion to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by Democrats and even some conservative Republicans.    An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plan in February estimated the total cost for the wall at $21.6 billion, but the White Houseâ€™s budget proposal for 2018, released in full on Tuesday, included a request for just $1.6 billion. Two Republican aides in Congress said the modest request is an acknowledgement from the White House that full funding is not realistic given opposition from Freedom Caucus conservatives in the House of Representatives as well as Democrats in the House and the Senate. Unless Trump is able to rally broader support and win more funding for construction in another fiscal year, his plans for a â€œbig beautiful wallâ€?that he promised during his election campaign last year may not be realized, the aides said. The budget, which includes 10-year projections for spending for most areas of the government, did not include a 10-year plan for funding wall construction.  â€œWe are absolutely dead serious about the wall,â€?White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday.  He said the Trump administration was still reviewing prototypes to determine whether to build fences, a brick and mortar wall or some other type of structure.  The $1.6 billion would allow the administration to build small parts of the proposed wall. Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.  Members of the House Freedom Caucus said earlier this year that Trump would have to show how he would offset the cost of a wall, which Democrats flatly oppose. Facing opposition, the White House pulled its request for full funding for the wall in the 2017 fiscal year and said it would revisit the issue in the next budget.  One of the congressional aides said Trump still lacks the support needed. â€œNothing has changed politically on the wall.â€?So far, the DHS has solicited bids for prototypes of a wall using $20 million in existing funds, but no government contractors have been selected to begin construction. A DHS memo shared with a Senate committee last month said the agency would be able to build 34 miles (55 km) of a levee wall in Texasâ€™s Rio Grande Valley and replace 14 miles (23 km) of fence in San Diego with $1 billion.

The program, whose roots go back to the Obama administration, has come under scrutiny by the Trump administration and some congressional Republicans who favor law enforcement, rather than community outreach, to fight what they see as a growing Islamic extremist threat. At the beginning of the administration, some White House and DHS officials considered changing the name of the program to â€œcountering Islamic extremism,â€?and refocusing the funding only on grants that dealt with the Islamic community,  not other communities that may have extremist views like white supremacists. The Trump administration has frozen $10 million in grants allocated at the end of the Obama administration under the countering violent extremism program and has yet to reallocate the funds.  The funding cuts proposed by the budget would reduce the $50 million currently allocated for the program down to zero for fiscal year 2018.  Congress must vote to pass the budget and it will likely be amended before being enacted.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1

The department appointed Mueller special counsel last week to ensure an independent probe, but an ethics rule limiting government attorneys from investigating people their former law firm represented raised questions over how Mueller would be allowed to operate. Muellerâ€™s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents President Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the presidentâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Kushner is now a White House adviser. Manafort quit the campaign last August, months before the Nov. 8 election. â€œUnder the Rules of Professional Responsibility, Mr. Mueller is permitted to participate in matters involving his former firmâ€™s clients so long as he has no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,â€?Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement.

MAIN STORY - Trumpâ€™s first full budget would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance programs that help the poor while it trims the deficit. The plan - if agreed to by Congress - would cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over 10 years, balancing the budget by the end of the decade. More than $800 billion would be cut from the Medicaid program for the poor, and more than $192 billion from food stamps. THE WALL - Trump is asking Congress for $1.6 billion for fiscal 2018 to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by Democrats and even some conservative Republicans. An internal Department of Homeland Security  plan has estimated the wallâ€™s total cost at $21.6 billion. AGRICULTURE - The White House budget proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years, with the biggest cut in the form of a $38 billion bite out of farm supports, including new limits on  subsidies for crop insurance premiums and caps for commodity payments. FOREIGN OUTLAYS - The Trump administrationâ€™s budget proposal would convert some of the United Statesâ€?foreign military grants to loans, part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy, aid and programs abroad by more than 29 percent. ENERGY - Trumpâ€™s White House would sell half of the nationâ€™s emergency oil stockpile and open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling as part of a plan to balance the budget over the next 10 years and ramp up American energy output.  FINANCIAL REGULATION - Two Wall Street financial regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission, would face cuts or major structural changes under Trumpâ€™s  budget proposal. The CFPB, created to protect borrowers from predatory lending, would undergo a â€œrestructureâ€?that would cut the federal deficit by $145 million, while the SEC, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund used to supplement its budget. ASSUMPTIONS - Trumpâ€™s promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to 3 percent annual economic growth and a vague â€œfeedbackâ€?effect that lowers the annual deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars.

0183,U.S. Labor Secretary says fiduciary rule to take effect on June 9,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department will implement its fiduciary rule on June 9 with no further delays, U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said on Tuesday. The departmentâ€™s rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to act in the best interest of their customers, has been heavily criticized by Republicans and Wall Street amid concerns it may make investment advice too costly. The rule has faced a rocky time becoming effective, with President Trump last month delaying its enactment date, originally April 10, for 60 days. Trump has also ordered a review of the rule. Acosta, in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, which was also shared with Reuters, said there was â€œno principled legal basis to change the June 9 date while we seek public inputâ€? Calling the fiduciary rule a â€œcontroversial regulationâ€? Acosta said while courts have upheld the rule as consistent with Congressâ€?delegated authority, it may not align with Trumpâ€™s â€œderegulatory goalsâ€? He also said the department was seeking â€œpublic commentâ€?on how to revise the rule, leaving open a possibility of repealing the rule in future. â€œThese are signs of positive movement for advisers and active managers despite industry disappointment that Labor failed to kill the rule,â€?Cowen and Co analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a client note. Some Democratic Senators on Friday raised concerns over the possibility that the Trump administration will permanently shelve the fiduciary rule. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0184,U.S. Senate confirms Iowa Governor Branstad as ambassador to China,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Monday to confirm Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, one of the U.S. politicians most closely acquainted with China, as President Donald Trumpâ€™s ambassador to Beijing. One of Branstadâ€™s first challenges will be pushing China to take a harder line against North Korea, which said Monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate-range ballistic missile, although U.S. officials and experts questioned the extent of the countryâ€™s progress. Branstad assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearing he would take a firm line with the Chinese government on issues from North Korea to trade disputes and human rights, despite years working closely with Chinese officials. Branstad said his long ties would help him push Beijing on difficult topics, including North Korea and thorny trade issues. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an â€œold friendâ€?after decades of dealings on agricultural trade during his long career in politics in Iowa, an important farming state. The vote was 82-13, with all 13 of the votes against the Republican presidentâ€™s nominee coming from Democrats. Speaking in  Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Branstad had worked hard to push relations between Chinese and U.S. regions and China hoped he could play an even more positive role in increasing understanding and promoting relations once he takes office. The United States has been trying to persuade China to agree to new sanctions on North Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile firings and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016. Trump has warned that a â€œmajor, major conflictâ€?with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. Branstadâ€™s move to Beijing will end his 22-year-long tenure as Iowaâ€™s governor. The longest serving state governor in U.S. history, Branstad is currently serving his sixth nonconsecutive four-year term. He is due to be replaced in Des Moines by Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds, who would be the stateâ€™s first woman governor. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0185,"Trump budget wants to halve oil stockpile, open Arctic refuge to drilling","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s White House wants to sell half of the nationâ€™s emergency oil stockpile and open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling as part of plans to balance the budget over the next 10 years, documents by the administration showed. The White House budget, which will be delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is meant as a proposal and may not take effect in its current form. But it reveals the administrationâ€™s policy hopes, which include ramping up American energy output.    The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the worldâ€™s largest, holds about 688 million barrels of crude oil in heavily guarded underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Congress created it in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of long-term motor fuel price spikes that would harm the U.S. economy.  The Trump budget proposes to start selling SPR oil in fiscal year 2018, which begins on Oct. 1, with sales that would generate $500 million, according to the documents. The sales from the reserve would gradually rise over the following years, peaking at nearly $3.9 billion in 2027, and totaling nearly $16.6 billion from 2018 to 2027. The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down U.S. crude prices for immediate delivery to just over $50 per barrel during Asian trading hours. [O/R] Yet the bigger effect, if implemented, would be more long-term as it is planned to last a decade. The Brent forward curve <0#LCO:> shows prices rising toward $55.60 per barrel by April 2018, but then declining toward $53.75 per barrel by late 2018. The White House budget plan, released just after Trump left Saudi Arabia, the defacto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is seen as undermining OPEC-led plans to tighten global markets by cutting production, and points toward a future of ongoing ample supplies. The Trump budget would also seek to raise $1.8 billion over the coming decade by leasing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, the largest protected wilderness in the United States, believed to hold rich reserves of crude. Increased drilling in Alaska would add to rising U.S. oil production which, largely thanks to shale, has jumped over 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million barrels per day. U.S. politicians have been debating whether to open the reserve in northeastern Alaska to drilling since the 1970s, with opponents citing the risk of spills and the contribution to global climate change. Trump has already moved to expand U.S. offshore drilling, including in parts of the Arctic, as part of his broader effort to support the oil and gas industries. He has also moved to trim  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including by proposing a more than 30 percent cut to its funding. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Monday that the overall budget proposal was part of an effort to help the U.S. economy grow at a rate of 3 percent a year.  â€œIt drives our tax reform policy, our regulatory policy, trade, energy ... everything is keyed toward getting us back to 3 percent,â€?he said. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the energy-related budget proposals. Trumpâ€™s budget would also restart a nuclear waste fund that would bring in more than $3 billion by 2027.  The Obama administration stopped charging nuclear energy utilities the fee in 2014 after it stopped the licensing process for Nevadaâ€™s Yucca Mountain - a waste dump that cost the government billions of dollars but never opened.  The Trump administration proposed reviving Yucca in details of the budget released in March.     ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0186,Trump budget calls for Wall Street regulators to face restructuring,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Wall Street financial regulators would face cuts or major structural changes under President Donald Trumpâ€™s fiscal 2018 budget proposal According to an Office of Management and Budget document on Monday, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law to protect borrowers from predatory lending, would undergo a â€œrestructure.â€?This would reduce the federal deficit by $145 million in the 2018 fiscal year, it said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund, established under Dodd-Frank, used to supplement its budget. In recent years, the fund has been used to overhaul the SECâ€™s information technology, including upgrades to the filing system for public companies and initiatives to help police fraud and track equities trading patterns. The White House document said the elimination of the fund would reduce the deficit by $50 million a year, which is the maximum amount the SEC is allowed to deposit annually. Currently, both the SEC and CFPB budgets do not impact the federal deficit.  The CFPBâ€™s $605.9 million budget is funded by the Federal Reserve, which is not subject to congressional appropriations.  Congress does decide the SECâ€™s $1.6 billion budget, but it is deficit neutral because the fees it collects from Wall Street firms are matched by the amount Congress sets aside. The reserve fund, which is separate from the rest of the SECâ€™s general budget, is funded through registration fees. An OMB spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about how a restructuring of the CFPB or the elimination of the SECâ€™s reserve fund would reduce the federal deficit. The CFPBâ€™s structure has been under political fire for years.  Republicans complain it is not held accountable because it is led by a single director who cannot be fired by the president at will, and it falls outside of congressional budget control. Last year, a U.S. appeals court found the CFPBâ€™s structure violated the U.S. Constitution. The bureau is slated to fight that decision on Wednesday, when the full panel of appellate judges will reconsider the ruling. Legislation proposed recently by House Republicans would subject the CFPB to appropriations. A report by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that such a change could help reduce direct spending by $6.9 billion between 2018-2027. The SECâ€™s reserve fund has long been a target of congressional Republicans, who have led efforts to prevent the SEC from using portions of the money. In July 2015, the SECâ€™s inspector general predicted that a cancellation of the fund would stall IT modernization and harm the agency. ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0187,Trump's budget proposes converting some military grants to loans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s budget proposal would convert some of the United Statesâ€?foreign military grants to loans, part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy, aid and programs abroad by more than 29 percent, the White House said on Monday. The cuts to programs under the State Department are in part meant to fund an increase in military spending. The White House budget documents showed total defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year at $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than President Barack Obamaâ€™s proposed 2018 fiscal year defense budget. The $603 billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense programs as well as the Department of Defense.  The Pentagonâ€™s specific defense request is for $574.5 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared to fiscal year 2017. Under President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal, the United States would spend 29.1 percent less on the State Department and â€œother international programsâ€?in the 2018 fiscal year compared to 2017, a decrease of $11.5 billion. That decrease includes a re-shaping of the way some countries receive military aid from the United States. Foreign military financing gives countries loans or grants to buy U.S. military equipment. The State Department decides which countries are given the financing while the Pentagon executes the decisions. Under the Trump proposal, many current grants would instead be converted to loans. â€œWe do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans,â€?said Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, in a briefing with reporters on Monday. â€œOur argument was instead of ... giving somebody $100 million, we could give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they could actually buy more stuff.â€?Military aid to Israel and Egypt, two close U.S. allies in the Middle East and the biggest recipients of U.S. military assistance, will remain unchanged, Mulvaney said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal, said the foreign military grants could affect Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Ukraine, Colombia, the Philippines and Vietnam. U.S. military assistance to partners and allies reached $13.5 billion in 2015, or 28 percent of all U.S. foreign aid spending that year, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most grants through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program go to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Iraq. Congress ultimately controls the government purse strings and may reject some or many of the Trump administrationâ€™s proposals. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have criticized the size of the cuts to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. Mulvaney said that aid to Pakistan would be reduced, though he did not give concrete details. â€?The) State (Department) still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that, but I do know that writ large we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program,â€?he said. Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the switch from grants to loans for military aid may mean that countries will not be able to afford U.S. military equipment, forcing them to go elsewhere for supplies. â€œCountries can buy from China or Russia. They have other places to shop, and one of the ways that we build capacity with our partners is through these grants,â€?Harrison said. â€œItâ€™s in our interest to have interoperability with our allies, and these military grants are a part of that.â€?Thomas Spoehr, who directs the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the conversion from grants to loans will be a challenge especially for smaller military aid recipient countries like Macedonia and Tunisia. Â Â Â  But â€œitâ€™s a proposal whose time has come,â€?Spoehr said, given U.S. budget deficits and high military spending overall. Â Â Â  â€œThis is probably a prudent place to make some cuts given all the other investments we make in national defense,â€?Spoehr said.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/23,1
0188,"Trump's budget depends on strong growth, 'feedback' for balance","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to 3 percent annual economic growth that he promised in his election campaign and a vague â€œfeedbackâ€?effect that lowers the annual government deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. The projections are a leap of faith that many economists and the Federal Reserve regard as unlikely in a country where the population is aging and productivity has lagged.  They also hinge on continued low interest rates, low inflation and full employment - a decade free not just of major economic shocks but of the sort of mild recession considered part of a capitalist economyâ€™s normal ups and downs. According to the summary tables released by the administration on Monday night, the administration is assuming economic growth reaches 3 percent annually by the end of Trumpâ€™s first term and stays there at least through 2027.  Actual first quarter economic growth was a weak 0.7 percent on an annualized basis, though current Fed forecasts expect about 2.1 percent growth for the year. Economic growth is one reason the plan forecasts tax receipts growing by around 5 percent a year even as the president promises tax cuts that â€œwill spur investment and create jobs.â€?  Inflation is assumed to hit the Fedâ€™s 2 percent goal and stay there, compared to the Fedâ€™s current forecast of just below 2 percent for 2016. The budget assumes the unemployment rate will rise slightly from its current 4.4 percent rate and stay at a long-term average of 4.8 percent. Without that jump in growth and the steady environment surrounding it, deficits would increase by as much as half a trillion dollars a year - around where they are now - according to administration estimates that include an â€œeffect of economic feedbackâ€?that reduces the governmentâ€™s annual shortfall by an amount that grows to $496 billion by 2027. The exact nature of the â€œeffect of economic feedbackâ€?was not detailed in the initial documents. President Barack Obamaâ€™s last budget assumed 2.6 percent annual growth, and even that is considered optimistic by professional economists and the Federal Reserve. Central bankers have penciled in trend U.S. growth of around 1.8 percent over the long run. Some Wall Street analysts, giving credit to some of Trumpâ€™s possible tax cut ideas, forecast economic growth could hit 2.3 percent in 2020, according to the latest quarterly poll of forecasters by the Philadelphia Fed.  â€œWith all due respect, the full fiscal Trump magic was never a realistic outlook,â€?Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. Growth since 2000 has averaged 1.9 percent in the United States; over the course of a decade the difference between that and Trumpâ€™s 3 percent figure compounds to an additional $2 trillion annually that would not get spent, invested or taxed. The administration is also assuming that interest rates remain low, with a 10-year Treasury bond rate that rises to 3.8 percent and remains there, a figure critical to projected government borrowing costs. While the 10-year bond has averaged near that level throughout this century and is currently well below it, periods of faster economic growth generally involve higher rates because of both the likelihood of tighter monetary policy and the likely demand for U.S. securities if the economy does accelerate.

0189,White House proposes $46.54 billion in cuts to agriculture over ten years,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The White House budget on Monday proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal government funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years. President Donald Trumpâ€™s biggest cut would come in the form of a $38 billion bite out of farm supports, including new limits on federal subsidies for crop insurance premiums and caps for commodity payments. The overall proposed budget cuts would eliminate the Rural Economic Development program, which provides zero-interest loans to rural utilities and support to rural businesses. It would also reduce government coverage of costs for federal inspectors at meat plants starting in fiscal 2019 by implementing $600 million in annual user fees for the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Food and Safety Inspection Service.

0190,Chicago launches ad campaign to counter Trump's immigration efforts,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago is starting an advertising campaign to reassure immigrants that they are welcome in the third-largest U.S. city, in a show of defiance to a crackdown by President Donald Trump on people who have entered the country illegally. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Monday he was not worried about the â€œOne Chicagoâ€?campaign upsetting the Trump administration. Starting this week, signs will appear at more than 200 locations including digital billboards, trains and newspaper racks with photos of Chicago immigrants highlighting the diversity of their backgrounds. Radio and TV spots will start this week with similar stories. A new website, onechi.org, features links for free legal aid and â€œknow your rightsâ€?training.The campaignâ€™s slogan is â€œThree million residents, three million stories, one Chicago.â€? The mayorâ€™s office said the campaign was costing taxpayers nothing. The advertising was designedÂ on a pro-bono basis by the ad agency Ogilvy Chicago and uses city-owned public-service advertising space. â€œIâ€™m not worried because weâ€™re not only on firm legal ground but firm moral ground,â€?Emanuel said. â€œWeâ€™re all immigrants and weâ€™re not going to let them divide us and say that person is not allowed here.â€?Trump already has threatened to withhold federal funds from cities such as Chicago that offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants who commit no serious crimes. The Justice Department in April singled out Chicago and New York, saying they were â€œcrumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,â€?even though experts say illegal immigration had little to do with Chicagoâ€™s spike in murders. Last month, a U.S. judge blocked a portion of Trumpâ€™s executive order that sought to withhold most federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities as part of the administrationâ€™s efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo on Monday saying that only Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants would be at risk for cities that â€œwillfully refuseâ€?to comply with federal law. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Emanuel, whose grandparents came to the United States as immigrants from Moldova, said the campaign was meant to reassure those feeling frightened about deportation. Chicago officials estimates there are about 300,000 undocumented immigrants in the city. â€œI see it with kids all across Chicago â€?they are nervous about their parents and nervous about their own safety because of the government and the rhetoric,â€?he said.

0191,Justice Department asks U.S. judge to reconsider ruling against Trump sanctuary order,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday asked a federal judge to reconsider a ruling which blocked President Donald Trumpâ€™s attempt to cut off federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, citing a new memo from the attorney general. U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco last month said Trumpâ€™s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican presidentâ€™s moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. The new filing comes in the wake of a memo released on Monday in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trumpâ€™s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  â€œThe authoritative position set forth in the AG memorandum squarely contradicts the courtâ€™s determination,â€?DOJ lawyers wrote. In Orrickâ€™s original ruling against the Trump order, he cited comments by the president and Sessions which suggested the government intended to target a much wider swath of federal funds.    Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing â€œsanctuaryâ€?movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communitiesâ€?trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trumpâ€™s order was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0192,"Trump can't stop American progress on climate, Al Gore tells Cannes","CANNES, France (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump cannot stop momentum to tackle climate change, former U.S. vice-president Al Gore said on Monday as he promoted his latest film on global warming at the Cannes Film Festival. â€œAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Powerâ€?is the follow up to â€œAn Inconvenient Truthâ€? the documentary credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the United States a decade ago.  Shot mostly before Trumpâ€™s election, it features the Republican candidate on the campaign trail promising to abolish environmental regulations and boost the coal and oil industries. At one point Trump tells a rally: â€œWe need some global warming â€?itâ€™s freezing!â€?But with legal and political obstacles, Gore said Trump would be unable to stop the momentum that would shift society away from fossil fuels. â€œWe now know after four months of the Trump administration, no one person, not even a president, can stop the climate movement,â€?Gore told a news conference at the French film festival. â€œThe courts have blocked parts of what President Trump has attempted and the Congress has refused to act on other parts of his agenda. The American people are determined to continue making progress and will do so,â€?he added. Since he took office, Trumpâ€™s administration has moved to unwind environmental rules but frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of keeping the United States in a global pact to fight climate change. Gore expressed hope that Trump would opt not to quit the 2015 Paris deal on climate change signed by most countries in the world. â€œI do believe that there is a better-than-even chance that he will surprise many by keeping the U.S. within the Paris agreement. I donâ€™t know that he will but I think there is a chance that he will.â€?â€œAn Inconvenient Sequelâ€?premiered at the Sundance Festival in January to mixed reviews.  Variety said it was â€œlikely to be another event, a part of the conversation, a movie that glories, once again, in the incisive power of its inconvenienceâ€?

0193,Flynn declines Senate subpoena in Russia probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn declined on Monday to comply with a subpoena from the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigates possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against self-incrimination, according to a letter to the Senate committee from his attorney, which was seen by Reuters. Flynnâ€™s attorneys did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The retired lieutenant general is a key witness in the Russia probe, which has roiled the first months of President Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency with a spate of negative news reports. Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner, the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence panel, said in a statement they were disappointed by Flynnâ€™s decision, but would â€œvigorously pursueâ€?his testimony and documents related to the investigation. The committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes into U.S. intelligence agency reports of Russian meddling in the election and whether there was collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Separately on Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump asked two of the countryâ€™s top intelligence officials, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers, to help him deny any collusion between his team and Russia during his presidential campaign. Coats and Rogers declined the request, the Post reported. Flynn apparently misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign connections when he sought to renew his security clearance in early 2016, according to a document obtained by congressional Democrats and released in part on Monday. Interviewed as part of the clearance renewal process, Flynn said all of his foreign trips as a private citizen â€œwere funded by U.S. companies,â€?according to excerpts of a March 14, 2016, report compiled by security clearance investigators. In fact, a trip Flynn made to Moscow in December 2015, where he attended a gala dinner and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was paid for by Russia Today, which U.S. officials consider a state-run propaganda arm, according to documents previously released by the House Oversight Committee. The document is the latest to shed light on how Flynn received a clearance and was hired as Trumpâ€™s national security advisor. He was forced to resign in February after less than a month for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Excerpts were released by Representative Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House committee. Flynnâ€™s decision to decline to comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena was first reported by the Associated Press. His attorney wrote to the committee that â€œthe context in which the Committee has called for General Flynnâ€™s testimonial production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him.â€?Flynnâ€™s legal team said he was rejecting the subpoena because the committee spurned his offer, made by the retired Army general in a May 8 letter, â€œto give a full account of the facts and to answer the committeeâ€™s questions, should the circumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent such assurances, General Flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for production of documents.â€?It was not clear what the committee would do if Flynn decided not to comply. Burr and Warren did not elaborate. Several panel members said they were waiting to learn more before coming to any conclusion about what might come next. â€œWeâ€™ll see what the future brings,â€?Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told reporters, adding: â€?This may portend that (Flynn) faces something serious.â€?    Senator James Lankford, a Republican panel member, said Flynn was within his rights to invoke the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. â€œWe will get to the truth one way or another,â€?Lankford said on Twitter. â€œWe need facts, not speculation & anonymous sources.â€?A Congressional Research Service report outlined three main options if Congress decides to enforce the subpoena: seeking criminal prosecution through the executive branch, asking the courts for a civil judgment and using a dormant power of â€œinherent contemptâ€?to detain and imprison an individual. The latter option has not been used in 75 years. Congress has more often relied on the criminal contempt statute recently. Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other advisers to Trumpâ€™s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the U.S. presidential race. Two other former Trump associates - one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Republican operative Roger Stone - have turned over documents the Senate panel had requested, while a third - campaign adviser Carter Page - had not yet complied, NBC News reported, citing a congressional source. Flynn has acknowledged being a paid consultant to the Turkish government during the campaign. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0194,Texas border county of El Paso sues to halt 'sanctuary cities' law,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The heavily Hispanic Texas border county of El Paso filed suit in federal court on Monday to halt a new law backed by the stateâ€™s Republican leaders to punish â€œsanctuary cities,â€?saying the measure was vague, cruel and unconstitutional. The law in Texas, which has the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, takes effect on Sept. 1 and calls for jail time for police chiefs and sheriffs who fail to cooperate in U.S. immigration enforcement. The suit filed in a U.S. district court in San Antonio on behalf of the county and its sheriff names Republican Governor Greg Abbott and others as defendants. It said the law would invite unlawful racial profiling in the county of about 800,000 people where more than 80 percent of the population is of Hispanic heritage. â€œHistory and logic supports that all Texans will not be equally subject to this harassment,â€?the lawsuit said. Abbott has said the law known as Senate Bill 4 will keep criminals off of the streets. Republican backers said there were no major sanctuary cities in Texas and the law would prevent any from adopting such practices. It was the first such legislation approved by a state since Republican Donald Trump, who has called for a crackdown on illegal immigration, became president in January.  The Texas law allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention. Supporters have said immigrants who do not break the law have nothing to fear, while critics contend it allows police to detain people for up to 48 hours for immigration checks, even for minor infractions such as jaywalking. Earlier in May, the small Texas border town of El Cenizo, filed suit against the Texas law in federal court, and many major Texas cities and counties have said they also intend to sue to halt its implementation. The Texas law has also faced criticism from the police chiefs of the stateâ€™s largest cities, who said it would divert resources from fighting crime to immigration law enforcement. They added it would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes. In a newspaper editorial last week, Abbott along with the sheriff of Hidalgo County, a border county with about the same population as El Paso, said SB 4 specifically prohibited racial profiling and discrimination.

0195,"Trump administration wants Obamacare subsidy case put on hold, again","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration asked on Monday that a major federal court case weighing the fate of the Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies be put on hold again, leaving billions of dollars in payments to insurers up in the air for 2017 and 2018.  In a joint filing with the U.S. House of Representatives submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the administration and Republican lawmakers asked for a second 90-day extension. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers want to repeal and replace the law and are working on legislation to overhaul it that would also secure the subsidy funding during a transition period. But it is not clear if or when they will pass it. The two sides said they wanted more time because they were discussing measures that would no longer require a judicial decision, including the new healthcare legislation. Insurers that are trying to set premium rates for insurance plans to be sold in 2018 are running up against deadlines and have repeatedly asked Congress to fund the subsidies during the transition. One Republican senator said on Monday that he believed the money for the subsidies should be appropriated by Congress. â€œI think we have to,â€?Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana told reporters outside the Senate. â€œWe need to stabilize premiums, or weâ€™re not going to have a market.â€?He said he was speaking for himself and not Republican leaders. The legal case was filed by the Republican-led House against the Obama administration to cut off the subsidy payments. A lower court had ruled in favor of the lawmakers, saying that Congress must appropriate the money for the subsidies and that the government could not simply pay for them in the way it does now.  Insurers and medical groups reiterated their view on Monday after the court filing about continuing the payments, which amount to about $7 billion this year and help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket medical costs.  â€œUncertainty is destabilizing the market and leading health plans to raise their rates for 2018 to account for the political risk brought on by Congress and the administration through a protracted debate over the fate of these reimbursements,â€?Margaret Murray, chief executive officer of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, said in a statement. While the proposed legislation from the House would keep the payments through 2019, Trump has said he could stop paying the subsidies at any time. That has insurers concerned that the monthly government payments could end and leave them exposed financially.         Several insurers, including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have already exited the Obamacare marketplace for 2018. Credit Suisse analyst Scott Fidel said insurers such as Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc that focus on the low-income families that qualify for the subsidies have the most at risk. Centene shares closed down 1.4 percent at $74.02 and Molina fell 0.8 percent to $66.84. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0196,Trump close to picking outside counsel for Russia probe: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is seeking outside counsel to help him during investigations into his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and has narrowed the search to four prominent attorneys, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The lawyers who have spoken to the White House and are widely seen as the finalists are Marc Kasowitz; Robert Giuffra Jr.; Reid Weingarten; and Theodore Olson, the Post said, citing four people briefed on the discussions. The Post said the four spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Giuffra met with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The person also said Kasowitz may have had dinner with Trump on Thursday. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meetings. Names could still be added to the list, but two people close to the search told the Post that Trump wants a team of attorneys rather than a single lawyer to represent him. It cited them as saying the team is likely to have lead counselors. The four attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment, the Post said, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. A White House official told the Post that the administration had no comment at the time. The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counselâ€™s Office, which is led by Donald McGahn, who served as the Trump campaignâ€™s lawyer. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1

An aide to the Oversight Committee could not confirm when the hearing would be rescheduled. President Trump fired Comey on May 9.

0200,"Trump says concerns about Iran driving Israel, Arab states closer","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that shared concern about Iran was driving Israel and many Arab states closer and demanded that Tehran immediately cease military and financial backing of â€œterrorists and militiasâ€? In stressing threats from Iran, Trump echoed a theme laid out during weekend meetings in Saudi Arabia with Muslim leaders from around the world, many wary of the Islamic Republicâ€™s growing regional influence and financial muscle. Trump has vowed to do whatever necessary to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, dubbing a peace accord â€œthe ultimate dealâ€? But ahead of his Holy Land visit, he gave little indication of how he could revive talks that collapsed in 2014. Trump will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Tuesday and the Palestinian leader said he hoped the meeting could be â€œuseful and fruitful ... (and) will bring resultsâ€? But in the Gaza Strip, dozens of Palestinians rallied against Trump and burned his picture and an effigy of him. Trump received a warm welcome in Riyadh from Arab leaders, especially over his tough line on Tehran, which many Sunni Muslim Arab states regard as seeking regional control. In Jerusalem, in public remarks after talks with Israeli leaders on the first day of his two-day visit, he again focused on Iran, pledging he would never let Tehran acquire nuclear arms. â€œWhatâ€™s happened with Iran has brought many of the parts of the Middle East toward Israel,â€?Trump said at a meeting with President Reuven Rivlin. In his comments to Netanyahu, Trump mentioned a growing Iranian influence in conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where it either backs Shiâ€™ite fighters or has sent its own forces. Trump said there were opportunities for cooperation across the Middle East: â€œThat includes advancing prosperity, defeating the evils of terrorism and facing the threat of an Iranian regime that is threatening the region and causing so much violence and suffering.â€?He also welcomed what he said was Netanyahuâ€™s commitment to pursuing peace and renewed his pledge to achieve a deal.  Netanyahu, in his remarks, did not mention the word â€œPalestiniansâ€? but spoke of advancing â€œpeace in our regionâ€?with Arab partners helping to deliver it. Israel shares the antipathy many Arab states have toward Iran, seeing the Islamic Republic as a threat to its existence.  â€œI want you to know how much we appreciate the change in American policy on Iran which you enunciated so clearly,â€?Netanyahu, who had an acrimonious relationship with former U.S. President Barack Obama, told Trump at his official residence. Trump, who is on his maiden foreign trip since taking office in January, urged Iran to cease â€œits deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militiasâ€? Iranâ€™s newly re-elected, pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, said regional stability could not be achieved without Iranian help, and accused Washington of supporting terrorism with its backing for rebels in Syria. He said the summit in Saudi Arabia â€œhad no political value, and will bear no resultsâ€? â€œWho can say the region will experience total stability without Iran? Who fought against the terrorists? It was Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Syria. But who funded the terrorists?â€?Rouhani noted the contrast between young Iranians dancing in the streets to mark the re-election of a leader seeking detente with the West, and images of Trump meeting with a galaxy of Arab autocrats, some of whose countries have spawned the Sunni militants hostile to Washington and Tehran alike.  He also said Iran would continue a ballistic missile program that has already triggered U.S. sanctions, saying it was for defensive purposes only. Trumpâ€™s foreign tour comes in the shadow of difficulties at home, where he is struggling to contain a scandal after firing James Comey as FBI director nearly two weeks ago. The trip ends on Saturday after visits to the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. In Jerusalemâ€™s walled Old City, Trump toured the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and became the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, Judaismâ€™s holiest place where Israel allows Jews to pray in a city sacred to three religions. Trump will have visited significant centers of Islam, Judaism and Christianity by the end of his trip, a point that his aides say bolsters his argument that the fight against Islamist militancy is a battle between â€œgood and evilâ€?

0201,Mississippi lawmaker 'sorry' he urged lynching for statue removal,"(Reuters) - A Mississippi state lawmaker who called for the lynching of Louisiana officials for removing pro-slavery era monuments apologized on Monday after his comments sparked a firestorm of criticism. Republican Representative Karl Oliver had taken to Facebook on Saturday to criticize the removal of monuments in New Orleans that city leaders deemed racially offensive. The last of the four statues, of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, was taken down on Friday. The Confederacy was made up of states that attempted to preserve slavery in the South and secede from the United States in the Civil War of 1861 to 1865. Oliver, a first-term lawmaker, said the monuments had been erected in the â€œmemory of our family and fellow Southern Americansâ€?and compared those taking them down them to Nazis. If those behind the removals want to â€œburn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED!â€?Oliver wrote in a Facebook post, which has since been removed. Oliver, a funeral home director from Winona, said on Monday that he had embarrassed fellow legislators and the state and that his choice of words was inappropriate. â€œIn an effort to express my passion for preserving all historical monuments, I acknowledge the word â€˜lynchedâ€?was wrong. I am very sorry,â€?he said in an emailed statement. Oliver did not respond to requests for an interview. Removal of the monuments provoked clashes between opponents and supporters, and workers wore body armor and face coverings to shield their identities.  Both Republicans and Democrats in Mississippi issued statements condemning Oliver, with Republican Governor Phil Bryant saying his â€œlanguage is unacceptable and has no place in civil discourse.â€?The state Democratic Party called it â€œinflammatory.â€?House of Representatives Speaker Philip Gunn had called on Oliver to apologize, saying his views did not reflect those of the Republican Party or the House and its leadership. Gunn has supported removal of the Confederate battle emblem from the Mississippi state flag, but has said he cannot get enough support from the Republican House lawmakers. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0202,Turkey summons U.S. envoy over Washington street brawl,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey summoned the U.S ambassador on Monday to protest the treatment of Turkish security officials in the United States during a visit by President Tayyip Erdogan last week, the foreign ministry said. A brawl erupted between protesters and Turkish security personnel outside the Turkish ambassadorâ€™s residence during Erdoganâ€™s visit to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. Turkey blamed the violence on demonstrators linked to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party while Washingtonâ€™s police chief described the incident as a â€œbrutal attackâ€?on peaceful protesters. The U.S. State Department said in a statement the conduct of Turkish security personnel during the incident was â€œdeeply disturbing.â€?It confirmed the U.S. ambassador in Ankara had been summoned by the Turkish government to discuss the â€œviolent incidents.â€? The Turkish foreign ministry said it summoned the U.S. ambassador to protest â€œaggressive and unprofessional actionsâ€?by U.S. security personnel to the security team of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. â€œIt has been formally requested that the U.S. authorities conduct a full investigation of this diplomatic incident and provide the necessary explanation,â€?the foreign ministry said in a statement. It said that lapses of security experienced during Erdoganâ€™s stay in Washington were caused â€œby the inability of U.S. authorities to take sufficient precautions at every stage of the official program,â€?adding that incidents would not overshadow what was otherwise a â€œvery successfulâ€?visit. Police have said 11 people were injured, including a Washington police officer, and two people were arrested for assault. At least one of those arrested was a protester. Washington said last week it was voicing its strongest possible concern to Turkey over the brawl. U.S. Senator John McCain, one of the leading foreign policy voices in Congress, on Thursday called for the expulsion of Turkeyâ€™s U.S. ambassador.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0203,Supreme Court tosses Republican-drawn North Carolina voting districts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Republicans in North Carolina unlawfully took race into consideration when drawing congressional district boundaries, concentrating black voters in an improper bid to diminish their statewide political clout. The justices upheld a lower courtâ€™s February 2016 ruling that threw out two majority-black U.S. House of Representatives districts because Republican lawmakers improperly used race as a factor when redrawing the legislative map after the 2010 census. The decision came in one of a number of lawsuits accusing Republicans of taking steps at the state level to disenfranchise black and other minority voters who tend to back Democratic candidates. The justices found that the manner in which the North Carolina voting district boundaries were sketched violated the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s guarantee of equal protection under the law. The ruling may offer a roadmap for challenging similarly drawn districts nationwide. The justices unanimously upheld the lower court on one of the districts and split 5-3 on the other, with three conservatives dissenting. â€œThe North Carolina Republican legislature tried to rig congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against African-Americans and thatâ€™s wrong,â€?said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat took office in January. Critics accused Republicans of cramming black voters into what the NAACP civil rights group called â€œapartheid voting districtsâ€?to diminish their voting power and make surrounding districts more white and more likely to support Republicans. Both districts are held by the Democrats. Of North Carolinaâ€™s 13 representatives in the U.S. House, 10 are Republican. â€œI donâ€™t know how any legislature can perform this task when the rules change constantly from case to case, often after the fact,â€?Robin Hayes, chairman of the state Republican Party, said of redistricting. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking a number of actions at the state level, also including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, in a bid to suppress the vote of minorities, the poor and others who generally favor Democratic candidates. Republicans have said the laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. Race can be considered in redrawing boundaries of voting districts only in certain instances, such as when states are seeking to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act. That law protects minority voters and was enacted to address a history of racial discrimination in voting, especially in Southern states. Eric Holder, who was U.S. attorney general under President Barack Obama and now heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group backing Democrats in redistricting fights, welcomed the decision. â€œTodayâ€™s ruling sends a stark message to legislatures and governors around the country: Racial gerrymandering is illegal and will be struck down in a court of law,â€?Holder said, referring to altering political boundaries to give a party an unfair advantage. The ruling was a rebuke to North Carolina Republicans but the districts in question have already been re-drawn. The new districts already have been challenged in court.  The Supreme Court has never said legislative districts cannot be mapped based on plainly partisan aims like maximizing one partyâ€™s election chances. North Carolina Republicans said one of the two districts, called the 12th congressional district, was drawn on purely partisan grounds to benefit Republicans at the expense of Democrats, and the other was drawn to comply with the demands of the Voting Rights Act. The split among the justices was over the 12th district. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in dissent that the court should have followed an earlier precedent in which a previous version of the same district was challenged. â€œA precedent of this court should not be treated like a disposable household item â€?say a paper plate or a napkin â€?to be used once and then tossed in the trash,â€?Alito wrote. Writing for the courtâ€™s majority, liberal Justice Elena Kagan countered that evidence at trial â€œadequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the districtâ€™s reconfiguration.â€?Conservative Clarence Thomas, the courtâ€™s only black justice, joined Kaganâ€™s ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had not yet joined the court when it heard arguments in the case in December, did not participate. The justices last week rebuffed a Republican bid to revive a strict North Carolina voter-identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act in a ruling driven by its conservative justices. Since then it has faulted some Republican redistricting efforts for racial reasons. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabamaâ€™s Republican-backed legislature improperly crammed black voters into certain districts. The justices on March 1 ordered a lower court to reassess whether Virginiaâ€™s Republican-led legislature unlawfully tried to dilute the power of black voters. The justices threw out the lower courtâ€™s decision upholding 12 state legislature districts. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0204,Trump sets out Mideast vision: backing Arab strongmen against Iran,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The images from the same night broadcast around the Middle East speak as loudly as the words. On the one hand: the young people of Iran, dancing in the streets to mark the re-election of a pragmatist, men and women together. On the other: the president of the United States, swaying through an all-male â€œsword danceâ€?under the stars with the absolute rulers of Saudi Arabia, where publicly calling for any form of political change risks prosecution. President Donald Trump told admiring Arab absolute monarchs and military strongmen in a gilt chamber at the weekend that he wanted â€œpeace, security and prosperityâ€? and the United States was not there to tell them how to run their own countries. He joined them in berating their arch-foe Iran, and signed a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that put him firmly on one side of the sectarian divide fuelling most of the Middle Eastâ€™s wars. The contrast between the two scenes was noted by Iranâ€™s newly re-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, who has sought to reach out to the West while batting back hardliners at home. â€œBuying arms or building weapons wonâ€™t make a country powerful,â€?Rouhani told a news conference on Monday. â€œThe foundation of power is national strength and this only happens through elections. Trump saw millions of Iranians took part in an election, but he visited a country whose people have not seen a ballot box and donâ€™t know what an election is.â€?â€œPRE-OBAMA ERA ON STEROIDSâ€?Trumpâ€™s attempt to orchestrate a Muslim and Arab coalition against Iran was a repudiation of the regional policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, whose administration held the first direct talks with Tehran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Although Washington and Tehran were still a long way from normalizing their relations, Obama reached an accord to lift sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program, which Trump repeatedly slated as â€œthe worst deal ever signedâ€? By swinging American policy back to firm support for the Sunni Arab states, Trump has jettisoned that carefully constructed balance, said Jean-Marc Rickli, Head of Global Risk and Resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  â€œWe are back in the pre-Obama era, on steroids,â€?he said. â€œUnder Obama you had this attempt of the USA playing the external balancer in the region. Now the regional balancer has gone. The balancer has chosen his camp.â€?Just as dramatically, Trump also repudiated the policies of Obamaâ€™s Republican predecessor George W. Bush, who promised to spread democracy across the Middle East in a landmark 2003 speech that declared â€œfreedom can be the future of every nationâ€? Trump told his audience of autocrats: â€œWe are not here to lecture you. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship.â€?Washingtonâ€™s alliance with the mainly Sunni Muslim countries of the Arab world against Shiâ€™ite Iran is decades old. But in practice the United States has had to improvise in recent years when choosing its friends in a more complex Middle East, where enemies can appear on either side of the sectarian divide. Washington and Tehran are still frequently on opposing sides, most notably in Syria, where Iran supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad. But elsewhere, notably Iraq, U.S. forces are fighting on the same side as Shiâ€™ites close to Iran. Obamaâ€™s outreach to Tehran reflected that reality. But those subtleties were cast aside on Sunday when Trump nodded approvingly as Saudi King Salman described Iran as the â€œtip of the spearâ€?of terrorism in the Middle East. A senior U.S. official defended the initiative, citing â€œa common threat from terrorist organizations as well as from Iranian subversion throughout the regionâ€? In fact, most of the militant groups U.S. troops have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, such as al Qaeda, Islamic State and the Taliban, are Sunni Muslims who consider Shiâ€™ite Iran their enemy. The timing of Trumpâ€™s uncompromising call for a U.S.-backed axis against Iran was particularly awkward because it coincided with the re-election of Rouhani, swept to a second term on his promises to seek rapprochement with the West. Although democracy in Iran has clear limits - all candidates must be vetted by a hardline body and the unelected supreme leader can veto policies of the elected government - it still goes further than in most of the countries that attended Trumpâ€™s speech, a fact noticed across the region. U.S. arms deals for Iranâ€™s Sunni foes help bolster the case of Rouhaniâ€™s hardline opponents, who say any detente with the West is dangerous folly. The Riyadh summit showed that the â€œpassivityâ€?of Rouhaniâ€™s government â€œhas emboldened the enemies of Iran,â€?wrote Hossein Shariatmadari, editor-in-chief of Kayhan, a newspaper closely associated with security hardliners who opposed Rouhani.         â€œSmall and weak countries that could not imagine a fight with Iran, are now publicly talking about forming a military alliance against it.â€?The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), the powerful Iranian security force that supported Rouhaniâ€™s hardline opponent in the election, has the power to stir up confrontation across the region to undermine Rouhani at home. â€œAll the indicators point to a further arms race in the region and on the rhetorical level we are on a path of escalation,â€?said Rickli. â€œYou just need a small trigger that can escalate the situation on the ground.  â€œI would not be surprised to see an increase in hostilities in Syria and Yemen. Also, the IRGC might want to foster pro-Shiâ€™a groups in Bahrain and some parts of Kuwait to regain power after the elections,â€?Rickli said. Putting a huge arms deal at the center of the visit also plays into the hands of foes who say U.S. policy is driven mainly by money. Saudi Arabia is both the worldâ€™s biggest exporter of oil and one of the worldâ€™s biggest importers of military hardware made in the West. Trump boasted about the jobs that would be created at home by the arms deals he signed. â€œWe will make sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world,â€?Trump said in his speech. â€œDoubling down on Saudi Arabia has a lot to do with trade and investment considerations.Â The supporting allies, anti-terrorism and anti-Iranian rhetoric provides a cover for that,â€?said Richard Dalton a former UK ambassador in the Middle East. But the policy could be counter-productive, he said. â€œFurthering more enmity with Iran, rather than seeking common ground and interests at a time when Iran is ready to reach out diplomatically on the regionâ€™s long-term problems, is going to work against the long term aim of a peaceful and stable Middle East.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0205,"Trump, Netanyahu's wife lament negative media coverage","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s wife, Sara, offered sympathetic words to visiting U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania on Monday, telling them that people still loved them despite negative media coverage. Standing on the red carpet and chatting minutes after Trump and the First Lady had arrived at Tel Avivâ€™s Ben Gurion airport in Air Force One, Sara Netanyahu was caught on camera exchanging a few private words with the visitors. â€œThe majority of the people of Israel, unlike the media, they love us, so we tell them how you are great and they love you,â€?Sara said to Trump and his wife.  Trump then interjected: â€œWe have something very much in common.â€?Trumpâ€™s presidency has received widespread negative coverage in the U.S. and international media, not least over his firing of FBI director James Comey and amid an investigation into ties between his administration and Russia. In Israel on the second leg of his first overseas trip since entering office, Trump is to hold talks separately with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a stopover lasting barely 28 hours. Speaking over the noise of the presidentâ€™s jet, Sara Netanyahu added: â€œI talk every place about how great you are,â€?she said, and Netanyahu backed her up saying: â€œI can testify to that.â€?Netanyahu and his wife have a tense relationship with the Israeli media, which they have both described as biased against them. In January, Netanyahu described the media as â€œleft-wingâ€?and â€œBolshevikâ€?and said they were out to bring him down.  Testifying in a libel suit the Netanyahus filed against an Israeli journalist, Sara Netanyahu told the court: â€œEverything that is published about me, itâ€™s all lies, evil lies that bear no connection with who I really am ... The media uses me as a tool to try and topple the prime minister.â€?Saraâ€™s red-carpet conversation soon began circulating on social media, along with another awkward arrival moment.  As the Netanyahus strode along holding hands, as they often do, Trump, walking alongside them, reached out to grasp the First Ladyâ€™s hand, but video circulated on Twitter appeared to show Melania Trump briefly flicking his hand away.

0206,Senator asks ethics office to review Trump hotel payments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate committee overseeing pensions on Monday asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to assess whether President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution and federal bans on conflicts of interest. Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. â€œTrump may be profiting from the retirement plans of millions of our nationâ€™s public servants,â€?Senator Patty Murray of Washington state wrote in a letter to Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, citing the Reuters report. The Office of Government Ethics is the U.S. agency that oversees conduct within the executive branch and supervises ethics officials to ensure they are preventing conflicts of interest and other violations. â€œThis looks like exactly the type of monetary flow prohibited by the Constitution,â€?said the senator. Murray, who is on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, asked Shaub to assess what steps Trump can take to ensure he is in compliance with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments.  The fees that public pension funds pay the CIM Fund III investment fund that owns the Trump SoHo may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House, the Trump Organization, and the Office of Government Ethics did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  At a January news conference at which Trump said he would turn over management of his companies to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, said divesting from his businesses would â€œexacerbateâ€?potential conflicts of interest because Trump would still be entitled to royalties from the use of his brand. Some of the pension funds have said Trump or the investment fund that owns the hotel should answer concerns about the chain because they do not have control over the assets in the investment fundâ€™s portfolio. Others declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump.  Other Democratic U.S. senators have criticized the president for not divesting his hotel management company and the hundreds of other businesses that make up the Trump Organization. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Trump was setting â€œan extremely dangerous precedentâ€?by maintaining ownership. ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0207,Trump wants more U.S.-Israeli trade with narrower U.S. deficit,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, at the start of a two-day visit to Israel, said on Monday in Jerusalem that he seeks a higher level of bilateral commerce but a lower U.S. trade deficit with Israel. The United States is Israelâ€™s single-largest trading partner by country, but third-largest regional market behind Europe and Asia. Israel was the first country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S., in 1985. In 2016, the U.S. exported $8.1 billion of goods and services to Israel while importing $17.6 billion from Israel for a trade deficit of nearly $10 billion.  Overall, the United States has a global foreign trade deficit of about $44 billion. Only 11 percent of total imports into Israel come from the U.S. â€œAlready our two countries do a great deal of business together. We have a strong foundation on which to build an even closer trading relationship that benefits both of our countries,â€?Trump said in a speech after meeting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. He then turned away from his script to Rivlin and added half-jokingly: â€œIâ€™m going to try and narrow that trade deficit just a little bit, is that okay?â€?Trumpâ€™s administration has ordered a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clamp-down on import duty evasion. He believes that large deficits are slowing American growth and employment. Over the first four months of 2017, the U.S. trade deficit with Israel has narrowed, to $2.8 billion from $3.3 billion in the same period last year, mainly due to higher U.S. exports to Israel. While Israel maintains a trade surplus with the United States, it has deficits with Europe and Asia. Hoping to re-start frozen Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Trump earlier landed in Israel on the second leg of a trip that began with a weekend visit to Saudi Arabia.  He will hold talks separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a stopover lasting 28 hours.     ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1
0208,U.S. Supreme Court leaves key campaign finance restriction in place,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a Republican challenge to a federal campaign finance restriction that prevents political parties from raising unlimited amounts of cash to spend on supporting candidates. The Republican Party of Louisiana had argued that a provision of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution. But the justices let stand a lower courtâ€™s ruling that rejected the Republican challenge. The brief order noted that conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch favored hearing the case. The conservative-leaning court in recent years has rolled back campaign finance restrictions. In 2010, the court paved the way to unlimited outside spending on elections in a case called FEC v. Citizens United that concerned corporate spending. In 2014, the court struck down limits on the total amount individuals can donate during the federal two-year election cycle. Both those decisions eroded sections of the 2002 law. The measure is commonly known as the McCain-Feingold law after the two senators who sponsored it, Republican John McCain and Democrat Russ Feingold. It barred state and local parties from taking unlimited donations for any activities concerning federal elections. Such donations are often called â€œsoft moneyâ€?because they are unregulated. They were a key target of the 2002 law.

0209,Trump says Iran must stop funding and training 'terrorists and militias' immediately,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Iran must immediately stop its financial and military support for â€œterrorists and militiasâ€?and he reiterated that it never be permitted to possess atomic arms. â€œMost importantly,Â the United States and Israel can declare with one voice thatÂ IranÂ mustÂ neverÂ be allowedÂ toÂ possessÂ a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease itsÂ deadly funding, trainingÂ and equipping of terrorists and militias, and it must cease immediately,â€?Trump said in public remarks at a meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. The United States brands Iran a â€œstate sponsor of terrorismâ€? It says Tehranâ€™s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syriaâ€™s civil war, Houthi rebels in Yemenâ€™s civil war and the Hezbollah Shiâ€™ite political party and militia in Lebanon have helped destabilize the Middle East.  Trump flew to Israel from Riyadh earlier in the day, on the second leg of his first overseas trip since entering office in January. In his speech at Rivlinâ€™s official residence, Trump said he was deeply encouraged by his conversations with Muslim world leaders in Saudi Arabia. â€œMany expressed their resolve to help end terrorism and the spread of radicalization. Many Muslim nations have already taken steps to begin following through on this commitment,â€?he said.   â€œThere is a growing realization among your Arab neighbors that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by Iran,â€?Trump told Rivlin.

0210,Exclusive: Trump EPA transition chief laments slow progress in killing green rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The man who led President Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, told a conservative conference last month that the new administration is moving too slowly to unravel climate change regulations. In closed-door remarks to members of the conservative Jefferson Institute in Virginia on April 18, a recording of which was obtained by Reuters, Ebell said Trumpâ€™s administration had made a series of missteps, including delays in appointing key EPA officials, that could hamper efforts to cut red tape for industry. â€œThis is an impending disaster for the Trump administration,â€Â Ebell, a prominent climate change doubter, said in the recording provided to the Center for Media and Democracy and shared with Reuters. Ebell was chosen by Trumpâ€™s campaign to lead the EPAâ€™s transition until the Jan. 20 inauguration, a choice that had reinforced expectations Trump would follow through on promises to rescind Obama-era green rules and pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change. Ebell had been seen as a candidate for the EPA administrator job, a post that ultimately went to former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt.  Ebell no longer works at the agency but remains influential within a faction of the U.S. conservative movement with ties to the Trump administration. His criticism reflects a broader disappointment by some conservatives about Pruittâ€™s focus and commitment to scrapping even more complex Obama-era regulations.         Since taking office, Trump and Pruitt have moved to unwind environmental regulations, including former President Barack Obamaâ€™s Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generators. But his administration has frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement, and hesitating to tackle the Obama-era â€œendangerment findingâ€?that concludes carbon dioxide is a public health threat and underlies many U.S. regulations governing emissions. Lawyers have said challenging that scientific finding could be time consuming and legally complex.  Pruitt has said he does not want the United States to remain in the Paris agreement but he has not yet decided to tackle the endangerment finding. At least three conservative groups have filed petitions asking the EPA to overturn the finding. â€œParis and the endangerment finding are the two big outstanding issues. Itâ€™s the first wave of things that are necessary to turn this country around, particularly in the heartland states,â€?Ebell said at the conference. Ebell cited the slow pace of key EPA appointments, including deputy administrator and various assistant administrators, a lack of experienced personnel at the White House, deep ideological divisions between the presidentâ€™s close advisers, and an â€œimperfect choiceâ€?of EPA administrator, as the main reasons Trump was not acting more aggressively on climate rules. He said Trump strategists should have allowed his transition team to roll out the full de-regulatory agenda before Trump took office, instead of delaying. â€œThe new president doesnâ€™t have long before inertia sets in,â€?he said. He also found fault in Trumpâ€™s choice of Pruitt to run the EPA, saying the former state attorney is a â€œclever lawyerâ€?but his â€œpolitical ambitionâ€?may distract him from taking-on time-consuming efforts like challenging the endangerment finding.   Â Â Â  A spokesman for Pruitt responded to Ebellâ€™s assertions, saying Pruitt had been implementing Trumpâ€™s executive orders and had spearheaded â€œabout two dozen regulatory reform actionsâ€?since taking up his position. Ebell also faulted Trump for choosing advisers with broadly different political perspectives and backgrounds - something he said was triggering paralyzing debate, instead of action. â€œHeâ€™s got people on different sides and they are all fighting over who gets these jobs and nobody has the clout except the president to say, â€˜Hey fix this, letâ€™s get this done,â€™â€?Ebell said.     In a statement given to Reuters on Saturday, Ebell said he is still concerned about the White House log-jam in nominating people for key EPA posts and the delay in making the Paris decision. But he said he supports Pruitt as an administrator and is encouraged by his recent actions. â€œPruitt was an excellent choice to head the EPA, and minor disagreements aside, his recent actions have made me even more confident that he will be an outstanding administrator,â€?he said. A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.         ",politicsNews,2017/5/22,1

0215,Israeli minister expresses concern over U.S.-Saudi arms deal,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel expressed muted concern on Sunday to a major arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia announced a day earlier during the visit to the region by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The central achievement of Trumpâ€™s visit to Saudi Arabia was  nearly $110 billion in deals sealed on Saturday in which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Although Israel also sees Iran as a threat to its security, it has a military advantage over the Arab states and has always been concerned about arms sales to them that could possibly narrow the margin separating them. â€œThis is a matter that really should trouble us,â€?said Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz prior to the weekly cabinet meeting, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of the deal in his customary public remarks. A senior U.S. official traveling with Trump said Washington understands what he described as Israelâ€™s â€œcompletely legitimateâ€?concerns and pledged to help the Jewish state maintain its military advantage. â€œWeâ€™re taking a whole bunch of measures, some apparent some not so apparent, to ensure Israelâ€™s qualitative military edge. That will in no way be compromised,â€?the official told Reuters.  â€œYouâ€™ll hear a really strong statement from the president on his commitment to Israel and to Israelâ€™s defense,â€?the official added.  Netanyahu has expressed the wish to improve ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states as part of an initiative that would draw the Palestinians into an eventual peace deal and function as a broad front against Iranâ€™s nuclear ambitions. Steinitz said he hoped to hear details of the deal. Trump and his entourage touch down in Israel on Monday. â€œWe have also to make sure that those hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia will not, by any means, erode Israelâ€™s qualitative edge, because Saudi Arabia is still a hostile country without any diplomatic relations and nobody knows what the future will be,â€?Steinitz said. In the 1980s, Israel expressed its concern at a U.S. sale to Saudi Arabia of then-advanced F-15 fighter jets that were stationed at a Red Sea airfield. But the desert kingdom has never threatened to use them against Israel.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/21,1

She is accompanying U.S. President Donald Trump on his first international visit since taking office in January, and told 200 female employees she tried to find balance between her role of First Lady and mother. â€œIt is about finding the balance,â€?she told the women, who took pictures of her with their smartphones.

The school, unlike most others in the conservative kingdom, has both male and female students of different nationalities. Saudi Arabia is well known as the worldâ€™s most gender-segregated nation, where women live under the supervision of a male guardian and need his permission to travel, study and get some health treatments. Since the late King Abdullah declared in 2011 that women could join the government advisory Shura Council, the situation for women has gradually started to change in line with moves to diversify the economy, employ more women and cut reliance on oil.

0217,"Iran foreign minister scorns Trump after speech, arms deal","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for sealing an arms deal and other investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia, Tehranâ€™s arch-rival in the Middle East. Zarifâ€™s comments came hours after Trump, who is visiting Saudi Arabia, urged Arab and Islamic leaders to unite and defeat Islamist extremists. Trump singled out Iran as a key sponsor of militant groups, sending a tough message to Tehran the day after Hassan Rouhani won a second term as Iranâ€™s president.  â€œIran - fresh from real elections - attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation. Foreign Policy or simply milking KSA of $480B?,â€?Zarif wrote in a Twitter post, referring to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Iran and Saudi Arabia have long accused each other of sponsoring militias aligned to their competing sects of Islam in conflicts across the Middle East. Introducing Trump, Saudi King Salman described Tehran as a mutual foe and a source of terrorism they must confront together. In his first keynote speech abroad, Trump sought to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world, and focused on his desire to curb Iranâ€™s influence in the region.  â€œFor decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror,â€?he said.

0219,Trump tells Middle East to 'drive out' Islamist extremists,"RIYADH (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Arab and Islamic leaders on Sunday to unite and do their share to defeat Islamist extremists, making an impassioned plea to â€œdrive outâ€?terrorists while toning down his own harsh rhetoric about Muslims. Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. His words aligned with the views of his Saudi Arabian hosts and sent a tough message to Tehran the day after Hassan Rouhani won a second term as Iranâ€™s president. The U.S. president did not use his signature term â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€?in the speech, a signal that he heeded advice to employ a more moderate tone in the region after using the phrase repeatedly as a presidential candidate. â€œTerrorism has spread all across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land,â€?Trump told leaders from about 50 Muslim-majority countries representing more than a billion people. â€œA better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and drive out the extremists. Drive them out! Drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land and drive them out of this earth.â€?The presidentâ€™s first speech abroad provided an opportunity to show his strength and resolve, in contrast to his struggle to contain a mushrooming scandal at home after his firing of former FBI Director James Comey nearly two weeks ago.    He portrayed the conflict as one between good and evil, not between civilizations, and made clear in a forceful tone that Washington would partner with the Middle East but expected more action in return. â€œThere is still much work to be done. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism, and the Islamists, and Islamic terror of all kinds,â€?he said in his speech.  The advance excerpts of the speech had him saying â€œIslamist extremism.â€?A White House official blamed Trumpâ€™s fatigue for the switch. â€œJust an exhausted guy,â€?she told reporters.  The term â€œIslamist extremismâ€?refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. As a candidate, Trump proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States. In office, he ordered temporary bans on people from several Muslim-majority countries, which have been blocked by courts that ruled they were discriminatory. The speech in a gilded hall bedecked with chandeliers is part of an effort to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world. Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica firstâ€?philosophy helped him win the 2016 election and has rattled allies who depend on U.S. support for their defense. Trump received a warm welcome from Arab leaders, who set aside his campaign rhetoric and focused on his desire to crack down on Iranâ€™s influence in the region, a commitment they found wanting in Obama. â€œFor decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror,â€?Trump said. â€œIt is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room.â€?Trump did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf nations in his speech. White House officials has said he did not want to lecture, something they believe Obama did, unsuccessfully.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif fired back at Trump in a tweet that Trump had attacked Iran in â€œthat bastion of democracy & moderationâ€?of Saudi Arabia and suggested he had â€œmilkedâ€?his hosts for hundreds of billions of dollars in business deals.      Introducing Trump, Saudi King Salman described their mutual foe Iran as the source of terrorism they must confront together. â€œOur responsibility before God and our people and the whole world is to stand united to fight the forces of evil and extremism wherever they are ... The Iranian regime represents the tip of the spear of global terrorism,â€?the king said.  Iran is a Shiâ€™ite Muslim country. The groups the United States has been fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on Washington and New York are mostly Sunni Muslims, and enemies of Iran. Iranian-backed militia are also fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq. The United States and Gulf Arab countries announced an agreement to coordinate efforts against the financing of terrorist groups. Trumpâ€™s welcome in the region was put on display during a series of individual meetings with Arab leaders. He praised Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, telling him: â€œYou have done a tremendous job under trying circumstances.â€?The Obama administration had a difficult relationship with Sisi, who came to power after leading a military coup in 2013 during which hundreds of demonstrators were killed, and has since jailed thousands of opponents. Trump promised to schedule a trip to Egypt soon, and he singled out the Egyptianâ€™s choice of footwear, a pair of shiny black shoes. â€œLove your shoes. Boy, those shoes,â€?he said. To Bahrainâ€™s King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, Trump declared that the two nations had a lot in common and â€œthere wonâ€™t be strain with this administration.â€?The king lauded the relationship and said it had led to â€œgreat stability in the region and prosperity.â€?Bahrain is home to the U.S. fleet in the Middle East. Its Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a majority Shiâ€™ite population and was occasionally rebuked by the Obama administration for harsh treatment of opponents. Trumpâ€™s Riyadh visit kicked off his first presidential trip abroad, with Saudi Arabia the first stop on a nine-day journey through the Middle East and Europe. Soon after Trump embarked on his trip on Friday, he was hit with more accusations that, with Comeyâ€™s firing on May 9, he was trying to squelch a federal investigation into his campaignâ€™s ties with Russia last year.

A Republican healthcare bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in early May seeks to overhaul the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion over the next 10 years from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled.

McMaster said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week with George Stephanopoulosâ€?program. On the â€œFox News Sundayâ€?show Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump was also trying to convey to the Russians that he was â€œnot going to be distracted by all these issues at home that affect us domestically.â€?Tillerson and McMaster were present at the May 10 meeting where Trump discussed his firing of James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister and Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States.  The New York Times, citing officials familiar with an internal White House summary of the meeting, reported that Trump referred to Comey as a â€œnut jobâ€?and said his removal would relieve â€œgreat pressureâ€?coming from the agencyâ€™s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Lavrov denied that the subject of Comey came up during the meeting, according to Interfax news agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin had offered to provide the U.S. Congress with transcripts of the same meeting to counter reports that Trump also disclosed classified information to Lavrov about a planned Islamic State operation. However, neither McMaster nor Tillerson on Sunday disputed that the subject of Comeyâ€™s dismissal came up in the meeting with Russian officials. Both said that Trumpâ€™s remarks had been misinterpreted. A steady drip of revelations about the meeting and the broader issue of Trump administrationâ€™s ties to Russia have complicated the presidentâ€™s policy agenda and threatened to overshadow his first foreign trip. Trump arrived on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the first leg of a nine-day trip and is due to go to Israel on Monday. The trip also includes stops at the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Brussels and the Group of Seven summit in Sicily.  Last week, former FBI director Robert Mueller was named special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. Russia has denied any meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Two sources told Reuters on Friday the administration was exploring whether it could use an obscure ethics rule to undermine Muellerâ€™s investigation. In response, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, said on Saturday she would introduce legislation aimed at protecting Muellerâ€™s probe. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have expressed varying degrees of concern about ties between the Trump administration and Russia and the presidentâ€™s handling of the matter. Republican U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona told â€œFox News Sundayâ€?he was left â€œspeechlessâ€?by reports of Trumpâ€™s remarks about Comey in the May 10 meeting. â€œI donâ€™t know how to read it except that, Iâ€™m almost speechless because I donâ€™t know why someone would say something like that,â€?McCain said, adding that the president should never have met with the Russian officials. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week with George Stephanolpoulosâ€?show he was trying to obtain notes from the meeting and expected to speak to the former FBI director on Monday.  On the same program, Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House panel, called on Chaffetz to subpoena the White House for documents related to the committeeâ€™s probe into Comeyâ€™s firing.  Comey is set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also examining Russiaâ€™s role in the election and possible ties to Trumpâ€™s campaign, in two weeks. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican on the panel, told CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€?program on Sunday he would ask the former FBI director whether he ever felt pressured to not do his job. â€œIf any president tries to impede an investigation â€?any president, no matter who it is â€?by interfering with the FBI, yes, that would be problematic. That would be not just problematic, it would be obviously a potential obstruction of justice that people have to make a decision on,â€?Rubio said. Rubio emphasized that he will reserve judgment until he has seen all the evidence and heard from sources, including Comey. ",politicsNews,2017/5/21,1

Trumpâ€™s agenda has been sidetracked by the hubbub over his firing of Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russia ties. â€œI think this foreign trip is something theyâ€™re all looking forward to because it changes the narrative. It buys them a little time,â€?said a Republican close to the White House. While Trump has privately vented about his staff, the source doubted there would be a major staff shakeup in the near-term. The source said there might be some adjustments in the communications team to enable the White House to respond much more swiftly to the news. ",politicsNews,2017/5/20,1
0227,"At a White House in crisis, Trump looks increasingly isolated","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the Trump White House, itâ€™s getting lonely at the top. President Donald Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans in Congress are showing signs of going their own way, both on politics and policy, determined to salvage what they can of their agenda on healthcare and tax reform in the wake of one of the most difficult weeks of any American presidency. At the same time, Trumpâ€™s failure to fill senior roles at federal agencies means he does not have a cadre of loyalists who can help rein in a bureaucracy that many in Trumpâ€™s orbit believe are out to leak information intended to damage the president. That has worsened the isolation of the White House in a city that relies on friends and allies to shake off a crisis. The result is problems on multiple fronts: a government whose bonds with Congress, federal agencies and the public look increasingly fractured; an ambitious but stalled program of reforms; and a president whose low approval ratings threaten his partyâ€™s control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump and his beleaguered staff, some White House aides told Reuters, feel besieged by a parade of negative stories and abandoned by fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, as the furor over the firing of FBI Director James Comey and allegations that Trump tried to influence the probe into Russian meddling in last yearâ€™s election show little sign of abating. Since Tuesday, when leaked excerpts of a purported memo by Comey detailing his conversations with Trump were made public, few Republicans beyond the White House have rushed to the airwaves to push back against suggestions that the president may have obstructed justice in asking Comey to end the probe into the conduct of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. As the Russia probe entered a new phase on Wednesday with the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in the investigation, a move that will likely place the White House under even stronger scrutiny, some Republicans expressed surprise that the White House had not done more to recruit them to backstop the president. â€œItâ€™s kind of funny. The answer is no,â€?said Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, when asked by Reuters whether the White House had reached out to him to come to Trumpâ€™s defense. â€œI donâ€™t know anyone else that has been contacted.â€?Â Â Â  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Trump left on Friday for his first foreign trip as president. The 10-day trip will take him to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe. Â Â Â  The administration has continued to struggle to fill the hundreds of open positions at senior levels of government that remain open, leaving the White House alone to grapple with one challenge after another. For example, the Justice Department still lacks senior officials in place to head up the anti-trust, civil rights, criminal, and civil divisions, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to its website. At the Department of Homeland Security, the chiefs of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration, have yet to be confirmed. And at the Department of Education, a sprawling bureaucracy of 4,400 employees with a $68 billion budget, â€œall the key roles except for the secretary remain empty or filled with people in an acting capacity,â€?said a Department of Education official. â€œNobody knows when or if they will be filled anytime soon,â€?said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The department did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has frequently complained that Senate Democrats have stalled the approval process for his nominees. But the White House has also been slower to send nominees to the Senate than previous administrations. Many top State Department posts also remain vacant. One consequence, say several officials, is that department experts played little role in briefing Trump for his telephone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin or his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, where officials say he disclosed highly classified intelligence. State Department and intelligence officials say that as power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few Trump loyalists in the White House, the roles of professional Foreign Service, intelligence and civil service officers have shrunk compared to past administrations. For instance, said two U.S. diplomats, no one from the State Department attended Trumpâ€™s Feb. 15 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a sharp contrast from past administrations which would typically staff such a high-profile meeting with high-level State Department officials. Asked for comment, the State Department would not address the circumstances of the meeting with the Russian officials in the Oval Office, but did speak to the efforts involving Netanyahu and the Middle East.  â€œAs the president has repeatedly noted, Middle East peace is a top priority for this administration,â€?a department spokesperson said. â€œThis is an effort supported by both the White House and the State Department.Â Claims that the State Department has not been involved have no basis in facts.â€Â?Overall, more than 500 of the 557 federal government positions requiring Senate confirmation remain vacant. Only 33 nominees have been confirmed, and only 57 other positions now have a nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in Washington. Â Â Â  A lack of communication from the White House left many Republicans on Capitol Hill frustrated as a sense of crisis mushroomed over the past week. One, Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own Russia probe, publicly complained about the situation. Tuesday morning, after news broke the previous evening that Trump had shared classified information with Russian officials, Burr said he couldnâ€™t get through to the White House, as the story lit up television news programs and buzzed online.  â€œMaybe theyâ€™re busy,â€?he said. Some Republicans said the constant focus on responding to allegations concerning the Russia probe was draining their caucus of focus and energy to push through their agenda. Absent guidance, Republican staff members in Congress were beginning to devise their own strategy about how to respond to the gusher of bad news, one aide told Reuters.  And at the White House, with lines of communication to Congress seemingly frayed at times, a narrowing circle of people has come to the presidentâ€™s defense, as senior staff grapple not only with the cascade of revelations but with a president who at times contradicts on Twitter their talking points. â€œEveryone is just tired,â€?said one White House aide.

0228,New Russia probe leaks threaten to derail Trump's foreign trip,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was hit on Friday by embarrassing leaks that a senior adviser was a â€œperson of interestâ€?in a probe of possible collusion with Russia during last yearâ€™s election campaign and that Trump had boasted to Russian officials of firing the man heading the investigation. The reports, emerging just as Trump jetted off to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as president, were likely to extend the turmoil engulfing his administration since the May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The Washington Post, citing sources familiar with the matter, did not identify the senior Trump adviser except to say that the person of interest was close to Trump, a Republican who entered the White House four months ago. U.S. law enforcement uses the term â€œa person of interestâ€?to mean someone who is part of a criminal investigation but not arrested or formally accused of a crime. The person may be cooperating or have information of use to investigators. Separately the New York Times reported that Trump boasted to Russian officials at a White House meeting last week that firing Comey relieved â€œgreat pressureâ€?the president faced from a law-enforcement probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  â€œI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,â€?Trump said, according to the Times, which cited a document summarizing the meeting and read to it by an unnamed U.S. official. â€œI faced great pressure because of Russia. Thatâ€™s taken off.â€?Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington in the Oval Office the day after Trump fired Comey, who was in charge of the Russia election probe. The Times said the document was based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the accuracy of that account. Comey, who has not spoken publicly in the 10 days since he was fired, will testify in an open session of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  Committee leaders said on Friday he would appear sometime after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on May 29. â€œI am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,â€?the committee chairman, Republican Richard Burr, said in a statement announcing the appearance. Public approval of Trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved. The remaining 6 percent had â€œmixed feelings.â€?U.S. stocks immediately pared gains after the reports but still closed higher for a second straight day. Earlier this week, investors dumped stocks in response to reports that Trump in February had asked Comey to stop investigating his former national security adviser, prompting accusations the president may have tried to hamper the probe. â€œAs the president has stated before - a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity,â€?White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement in response to the Post report. After days of political tumult in Washington, the Justice Department announced the appointment on Thursday of a special counsel to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. The Times report added to the impression given by Trump himself in a television interview last week in which he said the Russia issue was a factor in firing Comey. The White House has given different versions of the reasons for the dismissal. Asked about the Times report, Spicer said of the former FBI chief, â€œby grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russiaâ€™s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.â€?â€œThe investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it,â€?Spicer said, adding that the real story was the leaks of â€œprivate and highly classified conversations.â€?Democrats, who have compared the widening scandal to the Watergate break-in and cover-up that brought down Republican former President Richard Nixon in 1974, were quick to pounce on the latest reports. Democratic Senator Edward Markey called them â€œseismic revelationsâ€?and questioned whether the United States might be heading into a constitutional crisis.  â€œThis is an inflection point in the entire Russia collusion investigation,â€?he told MSNBC. â€œIt makes it very clear that what Donald Trump was trying to do was to end the Russian investigation.â€? â€œThis is what OBSTRUCTION looks like: â€˜I faced great pressure because of Russia. Thatâ€™s taken off,â€™â€?Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said on Twitter. Republican Representative Scott Taylor told CNN there was â€œno questionâ€?that Trump had â€œsome stumbles this week.â€?But he added: â€œI havenâ€™t lost my confidence in the president to be our president, I just havenâ€™t.â€?Before the latest reports, the White House had hoped to shift attention away from the political firestorm in Washington to foreign policy as well as the presidentâ€™s ambitious pro-business economic agenda in Congress. Trumpâ€™s trip, which also includes stops in Israel, Italy and Belgium next week, has been billed by the administration as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the worldâ€™s major religions while giving him time to meet with Arab, Israeli and European leaders.   Trump, who has embraced what he describes as an â€œAmerica Firstâ€?approach to U.S. foreign policy and international trade, is expected to be welcomed warmly by leaders in Saudi Arabia  and Israel. Lingering questions over his views on the Iran nuclear deal, commitment to NATO security and skepticism of the Paris climate agreement, however, could generate tension at meetings with European counterparts in Brussels and Sicily.

0229,Democrat Sen. Wyden warns of diminishing potential for tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Ron Wyden thinks Republican leadership is moving away from trying to implement full-scale tax reform this year and instead are turning their attention to simply cutting rates.  â€œIf you look at the language of Mitch McConnell in the last couple of days, heâ€™s talking about tax cuts, heâ€™s been saying, â€˜Well, I donâ€™t know about tax reform, letâ€™s have a tax cut,â€™â€?Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.  â€œTo me that would really be, again, contrary to what the president campaigned on,â€?he said. McConnell is the Senate majority leader.  Sweeping tax reform had been high on the Republican legislative agenda. But so far, House of Representatives and the Senate, both controlled by Republicans, have been unable to find consensus on a tax package that could pass both chambers and be signed into law by President Donald Trump.  Wyden argued there is robust bipartisan agreement that a tax overhaul is needed.  â€œThere are plenty of Republicans in Congress - because they talk to me - who would really like to do major tax reform,â€?he said.      Last month, the White House weighed in on the tax discussion, offering only a one-page plan that included deep cuts in rates, many for businesses, but stopped well short of legislative language or providing detail on specific changes. â€œThe tax reform proposal is shorter than drug store receipts I have,â€?Wyden remarked.  Several lawmakers have warned that if tax reform is not completed by the end of 2017, it will become more difficult to pass in 2018, when Congressional midterm elections will be held. The House has begun holding hearings and has developed a â€œblue printâ€?- including a controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports while providing credit for exports.  Wyden, in an echo of other senators, including Republicans, said that a border adjustment tax would be unlikely to fare well in the Senate - going so far to call it a â€œgrocery taxâ€?that would unfairly hit consumers in the middle class.

0230,Approval of President Trump drops to lowest since inauguration: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Public approval of President Donald Trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, after Trump was accused of mishandling classified information and meddling with an FBI investigation. The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved. The remaining 6 percent had â€œmixed feelings.â€? Americans appear to have soured on Trump after a tumultuous week in the White House during which the president fought back a steady drumbeat of critical news reports that ramped up concerns about his administrationâ€™s ties to Russia. The week started with revelations that Trump shared highly classified information with Russian diplomats in a private meeting. That was followed by reports that former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, whom Trump recently fired, had written memos expressing concerns that the president had pressured him to stop investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia.  Later in the week, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee an independent probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump has denied colluding with the Russians and called ongoing efforts to investigate him a â€œwitch hunt.â€?No politician in history, he said, â€œhas been treated worse or more unfairly.â€? While Trump remains popular with members of his own party, many rank-and-file Republicans appear to have backed off their support for the president during the past week.  Among Republicans, 23 percent expressed disapproval of Trump in the latest poll, up from 16 percent in the same poll last week. The decline in support from Republicans appears to be a primary reason why Trumpâ€™s overall approval rating is now at the lowest level since he took office. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,971 adults, including 721 Republicans and 795 Democrats. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for the Democrats and Republicans.

0232,U.S. senator insists special counsel won't derail Congress' Russia probes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator said on Friday that he expects Congressâ€?investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election to go ahead, even after the appointment of a special counsel, and said Congress has a broader mandate that extends to financial conflicts of interest. The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. â€œThe Congress has a broader oversight responsibility than just whether crimes have been committed,â€?Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a round-table meeting with Reuters.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes of the issue. â€œBob Mueller doesnâ€™t have, for example, the same broader responsibility to get into the kind of financial entanglements that I have especially focused on,â€?Wyden said. Questions remain about what contacts took place between Trump advisers and the Russians, and about Russia investments in Trump businesses.  In March, for example, the White House disclosed that Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, in December. In February, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other advisers to Trumpâ€™s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race. U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, whose views were seen as more in line with Moscowâ€™s. Russia has denied the allegations. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic sour grapes for losing the election. Trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. Muellerâ€™s appointment raised questions about whether he would ask Congress to step away from its investigation, or whether the dual track would complicate issues such as calling witnesses or obtaining documents. Some congressional Republicans have also suggested that Muellerâ€™s appointment would lead to changes in Congressâ€?investigation. Wyden said he would â€œgo to the matâ€?to be sure congressional investigators get what they need. He has already put a hold on Trumpâ€™s nomination of Sigal Mandelker to the position of under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence until Treasury hands over all documents related to financial dealings between Russia, Trump and Trump associates. Wyden also said he was looking into ways to obtain documents related to dealings with Russia by Flynn. The Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Flynn for the documents on May 10. His lawyer said on Thursday that Flynn had not yet decided how to respond. Wyden said he needed time to decide how to respond, but pledged he would do so. â€œWe still have to know more ... about how Russia corrupted our democracy,â€?he said. He said he knew that it would involve the Department of Justice. ",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1

0234,Ex-U.S. Congressman Weiner pleads guilty in teen 'sexting' case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner wept on Friday as he pleaded guilty to sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl, capping a â€œsextingâ€?scandal that played a role in last yearâ€™s U.S. presidential election during its waning days. Wearing a navy suit, maroon tie and his wedding band, a tearful Weiner, 52, described his conduct before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York City. â€œI have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,â€?Weiner said, apologizing to the 15-year-old girl to whom he sent inappropriate images and messages last year.  Hours after the court hearing, his wife Huma Abedin, a senior aide to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, filed for divorce in a Manhattan court, according to the New York Post. A lawyer for Abedin did not immediately respond to a  request for comment. The charge of transferring obscene material to a minor carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but Weiner is likely to get less when sentenced on Sept. 8. As part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would consider a term between 21 months and 27 months â€œfair and appropriate.â€?The plea deal appeared to seal the demise of a once-promising political career derailed by a series of scandals, stemming from what Weiner described in court as a compulsive need to seek sexual attention from women on social media. The investigation into his exchanges with the teenage girl also roiled the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign days before Election Day.   While searching Weinerâ€™s laptop, federal agents found a batch of emails from his wife. As a result, James Comey, then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced in late October that the agency was reviewing the messages to determine whether to reopen its investigation into Clintonâ€™s handling of official correspondence. Clinton, who was leading in national polls at the time, has blamed her loss to Republican Donald Trump in part on Comeyâ€™s announcement, even though the director said two days before the election in November that the review had uncovered no new evidence. Abedin had announced her separation from Weiner last summer after the latest round of explicit messages emerged, including an image of Weinerâ€™s crotch as he lay in bed with their young son. The controversy over Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state dogged her throughout the campaign. Trump accused Clinton of endangering national security by exposing classified information to potential hacking. In testimony to Congress two weeks ago, Comey said he felt â€œmildly nauseousâ€?at the suggestion his actions may have swayed the election, but added that he had no regrets. Trump fired Comey days later amid the FBIâ€™s probe into whether Trumpâ€™s campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton, an allegation the president has denied. Weiner, who served parts of New York City for 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, resigned in 2011 after an explicit photograph was posted on his Twitter account. He initially claimed his account had been hacked but eventually acknowledged he had sent the image as well as inappropriate messages to several women. Two years later, he announced a run for New York City mayor but dropped out of the race when more explicit messages became public. The federal investigation into Weiner came to light last year after the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, published an interview with the North Carolina teen. On Friday, Weiner said he has been receiving â€œintensiveâ€?mental health treatment since then. â€œThese destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my lifeâ€™s dream of public service,â€?Weiner said. In a statement, acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Joon Kim said, â€œWeinerâ€™s conduct was not only reprehensible, but a federal crime, one for which he is now convicted and will be sentenced.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0235,White House looking at ethics rule to weaken special investigation: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign team and Russia, two people familiar with White House thinking said on Friday. Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteinâ€™s hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation â€œhurts our country terribly.â€? Within hours of Muellerâ€™s appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firmâ€™s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said.  An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Muellerâ€™s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the presidentâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could  greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said. The Justice Department is already reviewing Muellerâ€™s background as well as any potential conflicts of interest, said department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. Even if the Justice Department granted a waiver, the White House would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about Muellerâ€™s ability to do his job fairly, the sources said. Administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if there is a basis for this.  Under this strategy, the sources said the administration would raise the issue in press conferences and public statements. Moreover, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge Muellerâ€™s findings in court, should the investigation lead to prosecution.  But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law, said the Justice Department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal.  She said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its results cannot be trusted, but she believes the argument would not stand up in court.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to undermine Muellerâ€™s credibility.  Muellerâ€™s former colleagues at WilmerHale, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are expected to join his investigation, according to a spokeswoman for the law firm. Neither Quarles nor Zebley represented Kushner or Manafort.  Mueller will now lead the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Trumpâ€™s associates and senior Russian officials.  Unlike Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel appointed by a three-judge panel to investigate Bill and Hillary Clintonâ€™s real estate holdings in the 1990s, Mueller depends on the Justice Department for funding and he reports to Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump.  When he announced Muellerâ€™s appointment this week, Rosenstein said Mueller will have â€œall appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1

Donovan will return to Goldman, the person added, asking not to be named because the matter is private. He withdrew from the position for personal reasons, the person said. Donovan could not be reached immediately for comment but a Treasury Department official confirmed he was withdrawing. â€œSecretary (Steven) Mnuchin offers Jim his support and friendship as he focuses his attention on his family,â€?Treasury Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tony Sayegh said in a statement. â€œJim has been an enormous asset to the department helping recruit and fill many of the senior jobs at Treasury.

0239,"White House moving ahead with stiff EPA budget cuts: group, citing document","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration plans deep cuts to state environmental programs, a summary of the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s 2018 budget showed on Friday, even after some Republicans in affected states raised concerns when the agency released an initial outline of the budget in March.  The EPA's grants to state and local governments on pollution issues from air quality management to pesticides enforcement would be cut 45 percent to $597 million in the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal the administration will send to Congress next week, according to details released by the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA). (bit.ly/2qFWvSl) The nonprofit group, an association of pollution control agencies in 40 states and various municipalities and territories, said details on the budget came directly from a leaked administration document.  More than a dozen programs to tackle environmental problems in environmentally sensitive regions, such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and South Florida, would be cut to nothing.  â€œYou would have thought the administration would have revised the budget in light of the overwhelming adverse reaction they encountered from previous trial balloons, instead ... they doubled down,â€?said Bill Becker, the NACAAâ€™s executive director. Several Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, had raised concerns about the EPAâ€™s plans to cut Great Lakes program funding. The EPAâ€™s budget proposal also includes an overall cut of 31 percent to $5.66 billion, mirroring what was proposed in a preliminary â€œskinny budgetâ€?the administration released in March.  The EPA would not confirm the veracity of the budget summary released by the outside group. But a spokeswoman defended aggressive proposals to cut the agencyâ€™s budget. â€œThe budget prioritizes federal funding for work in infrastructure, air and water quality, and ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace,â€?said Liz Bowman, an agency spokeswoman. She said the budget aims to â€œreduce redundancies and inefficiencies and focus on our core statutory mission.â€? The proposed cuts are a starting point and the Republican-controlled Congress would temper them in its budget negotiations. The Trump administration has targeted regulations, which it says have held back business. The budget cuts to the EPA and other agencies, such as the State Department, would help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. Also zeroed out in the EPA budget are programs on cleaning up lead contamination, reporting greenhouse gas emissions and managing indoor air pollution, the NACCA said.   ",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0240,Ryan says to send health bill to Senate after CBO score,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will send its healthcare overhaul plan passed this month to the Senate after it receives a final analysis by congressional reviewers, probably in a couple of weeks, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday.  Ryan said in a radio interview that the delay was â€œout of an abundance of cautionâ€?until the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its findings on the legislationâ€™s costs and its impact on health insurance coverage.     The CBOâ€™s analysis, or â€œscore,â€?is expected late Wednesday,  taking into account final changes to the bill before it passed the Republican-led House earlier this month.  â€œWe are just basically being overly cautious, but thereâ€™s really kind of a non-issue here,â€?Ryan told the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio show. â€œWeâ€™re moving it over to the Senate probably in a couple of weeks.â€?Republicans are eager to make good on their campaign promise to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.  Their plan narrowly passed the House on May 4 despite clashes within the Republican Party between hard-line and more moderate members. Ryan dismissed the likelihood that the new CBO score could force another vote in the House. The measure still faces a potentially steep climb in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrower majority. Senate Republican leaders have formed a Republican working group, but it is unclear how much of the House bill they will accept. Some senators in both parties have vowed to start from scratch.  â€œWhat weâ€™ve had so far is a debacle on healthcare,â€?Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee, said Friday in an interview with Reuters. â€œYou canâ€™t make this stuff up.â€?Wyden said he was wary of a Senate bipartisan group that is also working on healthcare. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy, who have proposed letting states decide whether to keep, scrap or replace Obamacare, have attracted several Democrats to bipartisan talks in search of common ground. Wyden said he feared the Cassidy-Collins approach would let states allow insurance companies to sell â€œjunk plansâ€?that do not include health benefits like hospitalization. â€œPut me down for freedom to innovate and flexibility, but on that issue, that doesnâ€™t mean the freedom to leave people without decent care,â€?Wyden told Reuters. Lawmakers in both chambers must also grapple with potential voter backlash ahead of the 2018 congressional election.  Public opinion polls have shown slipping support for Republican efforts. A Politico/Morning Consult poll this month found 44 percent of nearly 2,000 people surveyed disapproved of the House bill compared with 38 percent who approved of it. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosiâ€™s spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the House bill was becoming a liability for Republicans and â€œhas no chance of success in the Senate, and now may even have to come back to the House to be amended.â€?  Before the latest changes, the CBO had said the bill would leave 24 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The House bill allows states to decide whether insurers can charge more to people with pre-existing conditions and roll back Obamacareâ€™s Medicaid expansion. ",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0241,U.S. official backs Trump version on Comey firing timing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump decided to fire FBI chief James Comey before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo outlining his own concerns, Rosenstein said in a statement on Friday that lent credence to Trumpâ€™s version of events. When it was announced this month that Comey had been fired, White House officials initially pointed to the Rosenstein memo as a reason for firing the FBI director, who was overseeing an investigation into any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump said in a subsequent interview with NBC News that he had been planning to fire Comey before he received the Rosenstein memo. In a statement on Friday seen by Reuters, Rosenstein writes: â€œI informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove Director Comey, (and) that I was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns.â€? The statement, first reported by NBC News, Rosenstein goes on to outline some of his concerns with Comeyâ€™s job performance. But toward the end of the 2 1/2-page document, Rosenstein writes: â€œMy memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination (firing).â€?After Rosenstein briefed members of the House of Representatives on Friday, Congressman Darrell Issa was asked by reporters if Rosenstein indicated whether anyone had asked or encouraged him to write the memo about Comey. â€œI donâ€™t believe he ... indicated anyone directed him but in fact he wrote the memo,â€?said Issa, who, like Trump, is a Republican. Some Democrats left the briefing saying they were not satisfied with the information Rosenstein provided. â€œThere was a presentation followed by Q and A and not a whole lot of A,â€?said Democratic Representative Charles Crist. Representative Brad Sherman, also a Democrat, said Rosenstein â€œavoided at least 10 timesâ€?Democratsâ€?queries into whether the Justice Department official was pressured to write a memo critical of Comey. Sherman, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters that while Washington investigations are exploring whether there was collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Kremlin and a possible cover-up, â€œneither of them have been proven.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0242,"As Trump visits, Gulf states seen quietly curbing opposition","DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, departing from his predecessorâ€™s practice, is expected to sidestep human rights questions when he meets Gulf Arab leaders at the weekend and focus, to the dismay of  beleaguered government critics, on business and security. Civil liberties monitors point to freedom of expression as a right increasingly constrained in Gulf Arab states including summit host Saudi Arabia, which is planning to buy tens of billions of dollarsâ€?worth of U.S. arms.  Gulf Arab states began stepping up the muffling of political discussion in the dying months of former president Barack Obamaâ€™s term and have continued this under Trump, they say. â€œGiven Trumpâ€™s tenuous relationship with freedom of the press and free expression in general, we have no expectation that Trump would raise these issues during his visit,â€?said Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch. In Washington, a senior Trump administration official said human rights would not take center stage in Riyadh, where Arab leaders are expected to discuss combating Islamist militancy and what they see as the growing influence of adversary Iran. The official said Trump preferred to keep such conversations private, much as he did with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi recently when he obtained the release of an Egyptian-American humanitarian worker. Trumpâ€™s visit is likely to contrast with one Obama paid to Egypt in 2009 when he made an appeal to the Muslim world promoting self-determination, democracy and individual rights.  The Saudis â€œdonâ€™t want any more talk about human rights, democracy, political reform or gender equality. They had enough of that from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,â€?said Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.  â€œTheyâ€™re pretty confident theyâ€™re not going to hear it from Donald Trump.â€?While experts are not surprised, since the Gulf statesâ€?monarchies abhor discord and dislike free-wheeling political debate as practised in the West, they are nevertheless dismayed. The output of several columnists, economists and clerics in regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia and some of its smaller neighbors has either dried up or grown circumspect since the second half of 2016 in what critics see as an unacknowledged state drive to stifle public criticism, rights monitors say. Among those who have fallen silent are critics, both liberal  and conservative, of the kingdomâ€™s ambitious plan to diversify the economy and open up the country culturally under a plan known as Vision 2030. Until late last year Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi commented about issues including Trumpâ€™s rise to power on social media and a column in the pan-Arab al-Hayat daily. He also spoke in public appearances at think tanks. In December, news circulated on social media that Kashoggi, former editor of the Arabic-language al-Watan daily, one of the kingdomâ€™s top newspapers, had been ordered to stop writing or Tweeting. His account has been silent since November last year. Khashoggi declined to comment on the reported ban. Since the 2011 Arab Spring, Gulf states have stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough new cyber crime laws, sentencing offenders to prison terms for Web posts deemed insulting to rulers or threatening to public order. But in the past two years, unnerved by low oil prices and the slow progress of a war in Yemen targeting the influence of arch foe Iran, Gulf authorities became even less patient with dissenting voices in the media, analysts and rights groups say. Madawi Al-Rasheed, visiting professor at the Middle East Centre, London School of Economics, said Riyadh was engaged in an effort to muzzle intellectuals with â€œdissenting voicesâ€? â€œThere are so many of them, both men and women, who have left the kingdom,â€?she said. Activists say muzzled writers include economists, academics, columnists and Muslim clerics. There are no precise figures on how many have been affected, but estimates by activists put the number at more than 20 from Saudi Arabia alone. While some were merely advised not to air their views on social media, more vocal critics have found themselves behind bars, facing possible indictments on charges such as disobeying the ruler or incitement against the state, rights activists say. â€œThe pursuit by security is increasing rapidly and ... it is killing the voice of moderation,â€?said Walid Sulais, a Saudi rights activist who fled abroad in late 2016 after authorities summoned him for questioning over his rights work. Gulf Arab officials did not respond to requests for comment on the issue of free expression. But asked about the expected absence of human rights from Trumpâ€™s agenda, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the issue was one of definition. â€œWe look at human rights as the right to safety, the right to a decent life, the right to a job, the right to food. We see it as the right to live your life without people imposing on you,â€?he told a news conference on Thursday. â€œEvery Saudi has the right to petition his monarch or the governors. The doors of our leaders are open. We have built institutions. We have a thriving press corps. We have a consultative council that started with 60 members, today it has 150 members, and 30 of them areÂ ladies, distinguished ladies.â€Â?Gulf states have increasingly chafed at what they see as a campaign of vilification by Western media and rights groups. They insist they respect rights which do not violate Islamic Sharia laws and their societiesâ€?conservative traditions. Political parties are banned in Saudi Arabia as are protests, unions are illegal, the press is controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison. Riyadh says it does not have political prisoners, while top officials have said monitoring activists is needed to keep social stability.  In a statement on Jan. 15, Bahrainâ€™s information minister scolded Gulf media, warning outlets to â€œshoulder their responsibilitiesâ€?and counter foreign attempts to â€œspread seditionâ€?in Gulf states - an apparent reference to Iran which Bahrain accuses of fomenting unrest among Bahraini Shiâ€™ites. Iran denies interfering in the affairs of Gulf states.     Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman, have also been accused by rights groups of curbing free expression. In Qatar, activists noted that Faisal al-Marzoqi, a prominent commentator with more than 100,000 Twitter followers, had not tweeted since November 2016. The UAE said on March 21 it had arrested political activist Ahmed Mansoor, an electrical engineer and poet, on charges of spreading sectarianism and hatred on social media, a move criticized by Amnesty International. Defending the move, Mohammed al-Hammadi, editor of the pro-government al-Ittihad newspaper, wrote that Mansoor â€œeither will be convicted or will be cleared through the rule of law and the justice of the judiciary, so what is the problem with this?â€?In February Saudi social media reported the arrest of prominent clerics Sheikh Essam al-Owayed and Saad al-Breik. In a Twitter post on Feb. 23, Owayed wrote in apparent reference to liberalizing reforms: â€œAny decision-maker who thinks he can change the faith and identity of this country by opening the doors to decadence would be calling for a war in which he would be the main loser, no matter who he is.â€?Owayedâ€™s Twitter account has had no new postings since then, while the last Twitter message on Breikâ€™s account dates to March 20. Neither Owayed nor Breik could be reached for a comment. On May 4 on a visit to Saudi Arabia, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson urged Riyadh to stop using a 2014 counter-terrorism law and security prohibitions against human rights defenders and writers.  â€œWhen he is meeting with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries there, he should be equally as clear that any counter-terrorism efforts must include safeguards to protect the rights of individuals to express their opinions and assemble peacefully,â€?Philip Luther, Amnesty Internationalâ€™s director for the Middle East and North Africa, told Reuters.

0245,Senators raise alarms about shelving retirement advice rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. Democratic Senators on Friday raised concerns over the possibility that President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration will permanently shelve the â€œfiduciary rule,â€?aimed at preventing brokers from recommending inappropriate retirement investments. The most senior Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing pensions, Washingtonâ€™s Patty Murray, and two of the partyâ€™s liberal stars who advocated for the rule, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, wrote to newly confirmed Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta about reports that he was looking for a way to freeze the rule and make it â€œstick.â€?Earlier this month, the National Association of Plan Advisors cited Acosta as saying he was seeking the long-term freeze in a meeting with Republican Senator Tim Scott, of South Carolina. He added that he was in constant communication with the White House and â€œrecognized the urgency of the situation,â€?the group said in a blog post citing a â€œcommunication from Scottâ€™s office.â€?Scottâ€™s spokeswoman Michele Exner told Reuters she did not know what the two discussed in their meeting, what Acosta had said, or anything about the communication cited.  Labor Department Spokeswoman Jillian Rogers said she would ask Acosta, currently in Germany, about the conversation and if permanently paralyzing the rule was a department priority. Approved last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, the rule was intended to ensure that financial advisers put their clientsâ€?interests first, and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products that line brokersâ€?pockets. Heavily criticized by Wall Street and Republicans for potentially raising the cost of investment advice, the rule has faced a rocky time becoming effective, with Trump last month delaying its enactment date, originally April 10, for 60 days. Trump has also ordered a review of the rule. â€œInstead of meeting with all stakeholders and considering multiple points of view, you appear to have prejudged the outcome of the review,â€?the senators wrote in a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. They said an analysis accompanying the ruleâ€™s release that found conflicts of interest would cost those saving for retirement $17 billion annually. They warned there are â€œsteep legal standardsâ€?that the Labor Department would have to meet to â€œjustify further delaying, substantially revising, or rescinding this rule.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0246,Trump budget to give first look at infrastructure plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will propose $200 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years in his first budget on Tuesday - funding the administration believes will boost private, state and local spending on projects, a White House official said on Friday. The infrastructure plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, is likely to include funding to encourage state and local governments to lease assets to the private sector to generate funding for other projects. Trump has long pledged a $1 trillion, 10-year plan to modernize U.S. roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and water systems, but has so far been vague on how much of the spending would come from the federal government. Trump, who leaves on Friday for his first foreign trip, will miss the roll-out of his full budget. He was to meet with his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, on Friday before departing. The budget will also include details about Trumpâ€™s proposals to cut foreign aid and boost military spending. It could provide clues on his plan to cut taxes. The Washington Post reported that the budget will include funds for a program to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, expected to cost about $25 billion a year. While Trump can propose programs, Congress ultimately controls spending and rarely approves White House budget plans as proposed. Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, but were lukewarm to Trumpâ€™s initial â€œskinny budgetâ€?plan for fiscal 2018, released in March. ",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0247,Trump faces diplomatic hurdles during 28 hours in the Holy Land,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. presidential trips are an opportunity to project power and burnish statesmanship. But they come with diplomatic dangers and potential pitfalls, too. For Donald Trump, several of those await in Jerusalem and Bethlehem next week. A nine-day tour taking in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Palestinian territories, the Vatican and NATO would be a tall order for any president. But for Trump, under siege at home over questions about his administrationâ€™s links to Russia and his firing of FBI chief James Comey, it is a particularly demanding itinerary, especially for a first overseas venture. During his campaign, Trump promised to be Israelâ€™s â€œbest friendâ€?if elected, and signaled that it was okay for the Israeli government to go on building settlements on occupied land since he didnâ€™t regard it as an obstacle to peace. Since taking office, however, Trump has shifted tack, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to â€œhold backâ€?on settlements, and praising Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a White House meeting this month, part of an effort to bring the sides together and launch another attempt at Middle East peace. It looks unlikely Trump will manage to get Netanyahu and Abbas to shake hands during his 28-hour visit to the Holy Land, and the prospects of him setting a timetable for a resumption of peace talks also look dim. But that doesnâ€™t mean other diplomatic traps arenâ€™t lying in wait. Perhaps the most sensitive is what Trump ends up saying â€?or not saying â€?about a promise he made during the election campaign to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. No country in the world has its embassy to Israel in Jerusalem since the status of the city remains disputed in the eyes of the international community. While Israelis call Jerusalem their â€œindivisible capitalâ€? Palestinians want the capital of any future state in the east of the city. Only once Jerusalemâ€™s final status is agreed via direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians are foreign countries likely to move their embassies to the city. In the meantime, Trump has appointed as his envoy to Israel David Friedman, a devout Jew who insists the embassy must be moved and plans to work out of Jerusalem some days of the week. When Friedman arrived in Israel this week, his first act was to visit Jerusalemâ€™s Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, a symbolic departure from usual protocol. Trump intends to visit the Western Wall too, something past presidents have not done because of the political sensitivities. The Wall stands in the Old City in the east of Jerusalem, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war. Officially, the United Nations, the United States and others consider the Old City and East Jerusalem occupied territory and do not recognize Israelâ€™s claim to sovereignty over it. As a result, the U.S. State Department turned down a request for Netanyahu to accompany Trump and his family when they visit the site on Monday. Instead, the president will be accompanied by the rabbi of the Western Wall. â€œThis is the most appropriate way to show the proper deference to such a significant holy site,â€?a State Department official said. Yet in an interview with Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu paper, Trump said his plans â€œcould still changeâ€?and suggested he might ask Netanyahu to join him, a last-minute move that would please Netanyahu but anger the Palestinians. On Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to visit Abbas for an hour in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, which lies a few kilometers south of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  To get there, the presidentâ€™s convoy will have to pass through Israelâ€™s high-security checkpoint and towering concrete barriers that cut the West Bank off from Jerusalem. Both Palestinians and Israelis will be on alert to see what language Trump uses when he meets Abbas. While the president hasnâ€™t clearly backed a two-state solution â€?Israel and a Palestinian state â€?he is expected to voice support for Palestinian â€œself-determinationâ€? a phrase that nods in the direction of an independent Palestinian state. After negotiating that diplomatic minefield, Trump is scheduled to visit Yad Vashem, Israelâ€™s Holocaust Memorial. He has set aside 15 minutes for the visit, unlike previous presidents who spent an hour or more at the site.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/19,1
0248,Trump under pressure to assure NATO allies he has their back,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Standing in front of a memorial made of remnants of the World Trade Center, U.S. President Donald Trump will have a powerful symbolic opportunity in Brussels next Thursday to make clear how he really feels about NATO.  But as controversies swirl around Trump over alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia, it is unclear whether the Republican president - who slammed the post-World War Two military alliance as â€œobsoleteâ€?when he was running for office - will say the words that whipsawed NATO partners really want to hear. Alarmed by Russian aggression in Ukraine and wary of the U.S. administrationâ€™s efforts to build friendlier ties with Moscow, European partners want to know if they have Trumpâ€™s staunch support. While the White House says Trump will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the alliance in his remarks at NATO, allies also want a full-throated endorsement of Article 5 of the treaty - the principal that an attack against one member is treated as an attack against all. The 28-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was formed in 1949 during the Cold War, has invoked the collective defense article only once - after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that leveled the World Trade Centerâ€™s twin towers in New York, Trumpâ€™s hometown. Trump plans to dedicate a memorial to the invocation of Article 5 at the new NATO headquarters.  â€œThe problem in the plan is that President Trump is the only president who has not yet explicitly endorsed Article 5,â€?said Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution think tank. â€œI understand that is not an accident.â€?On the campaign trail, Trump accused NATO allies of not paying their fair share for defense and not focusing enough on the fight against terrorism. Since last Novemberâ€™s election, Trump and his aides have tempered those remarks. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis - who will travel with Trump to Brussels - has pledged support to Article 5, as has Vice President Mike Pence. Trump has said publicly his views on NATO have changed, telling reporters during a White House visit with NATOâ€™s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that NATO was â€œno longer obsolete.â€?â€œHe has never said, like Pence, like Mattis, that U.S. commitment to Article 5 is rock solid, and allies want to hear that at this summit,â€?said Julie Smith, national security aide to former Vice President Joe Biden. While abroad, Trump will be shadowed by the political tumult that ensued after his firing earlier this month of FBI Director James Comey. The U.S. Justice Department has named a special counsel to probe possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia, which Trump denies. He said on Thursday he was the victim of a political witch hunt. Trump, who took office in January, departs on Friday for his first foreign trip as president and will visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican and Sicily in addition to Brussels. A senior White House official said Trump would press his demands for NATO partners to step up their defense spending. The message may undercut any effort to offer reassurance to NATO allies about the commitment to the alliance and to Europe, said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States and Britain. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a frequent Trump critic, expressed frustration with the presidentâ€™s NATO stance. Asked by a reporter what he would like to see Trump do to reassure NATO allies, McCain laughed, saying: â€œTalk about his commitment to NATO - that would be an opener.â€?

0249,"Trump denies asking Comey to drop probe, decries 'witch hunt'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, striking a defiant tone on Thursday after days of political tumult, denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into his former national security adviser and decried a â€œwitch huntâ€?against him.  Trumpâ€™s terse denial followed reports by Reuters and other media about a memo written by Comey alleging that Trump made the request to close down the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia in February. Trump fired Comey on May 9. â€œNo. No. Next question,â€?Trump told a news conference in the White House, when asked if he â€œin any way, shape or formâ€?ever urged Comey to end the probe. Comeyâ€™s dismissal last week set off a series of jarring developments that culminated on Wednesday in the Justice Departmentâ€™s appointment of a special counsel to probe possible ties between Russia and Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign. They included media reports that Trump discussed sensitive intelligence on the Islamic State militant group with Russiaâ€™s foreign minister.     In a pair of morning Twitter posts and at a later news conference, the Republican president described calls by some on the left for his impeachment as â€œridiculousâ€?and said he had done nothing to warrant criminal charges. â€œThe entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign - but I can always speak for myself - and the Russians. Zero,â€?he told the news conference, standing alongside Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. In his earlier Twitter posts, Trump criticized the naming of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, an official he himself appointed. â€œWith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!â€?Trump wrote on Thursday morning.  He did not offer any evidence of such acts in his reference to former Democratic President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. â€œThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!â€?Trump tweeted. Democrats rejected Trumpâ€™s characterization. â€œThis is a truth hunt,â€?said Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€?conclusion that it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Trump has long bristled at the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory over Clinton. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russiaâ€™s ambassador.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other Trump campaign advisers were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. U.S. stocks recovered ground on Thursday as upbeat economic data emboldened investors to return to the market, a day after Wall Street saw the biggest selloff in eight months on worries the political turmoil could undermine Trump initiatives such as tax cuts that investors see as favoring economic growth. Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, named Mueller amid mounting pressure in Congress for an independent investigation beyond existing FBI and congressional probes into the Russia issue. Trump later told news anchors at the White House that Muellerâ€™s appointment was a â€œvery, very negative thing,â€?adding: â€œI believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows weâ€™re a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country.â€?Rosenstein briefed senators on Thursday but made no public comments. One of the attendees, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Rosenstein as anxious and nervous and said he drank multiple glasses of water â€œand spilled one.â€?Afterward, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters that â€œeverything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may be a criminal investigation.â€?A self-described friend of Comeyâ€™s wrote in a public blog post on Thursday that Comey had told him that he had rebuffed a Trump request for loyalty by promising only honesty. â€œHe also told me that Trump was perceptibly uncomfortable with this answer,â€?wrote Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a critic of Trump.  â€œAnd he said that ever since, the President had been trying to be chummy in a fashion that Comey felt was designed to absorb him into Trumpâ€™s world - to make him part of the team.â€?Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said Rosenstein told senators that he knew Comey would be fired before he wrote his letter accusing him of missteps as FBI director, including his handling of an election-year probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The White House initially said last week that Trump was prompted to fire Comey after reading the Rosenstein letter. Trump later said he had already decided to dismiss him and was thinking of â€œthis Russia thing.â€?The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump called Comey weeks after he took office on Jan. 20 and asked him when federal authorities were going to say Trump was not under investigation. It cited two people briefed on the call.   Comey told Trump he should not contact him directly about FBI investigations but follow procedure and have the White House counsel ask the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, the Times reported. A key issue Mueller may have to tackle is whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice, an offense that could be used in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office.  Asked about possible obstruction of justice, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters the special counsel would â€œfollow the facts where ever they may leadâ€?and that â€œit is premature to prejudge anything at this point.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0250,"For Trump's defenders, White House turmoil is politics as usual","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In Washington, the chatter about a deepening, Watergate-style crisis has engulfed the White House - and those conversations are echoed in big cities across the country and in a succession of headlines that seem to suggest almost certain doom for the young Trump administration. But for many Americans, including President Donald Trumpâ€™s staunchest supporters, the â€œcrisis in Washingtonâ€?is not about possible missteps by Trump or questions over whether his campaign colluded with Russia. For them, itâ€™s the latest egregious example of mainstream media bias and of Washington insiders desperate to preserve their status taking revenge on the New York celebrity businessman. In such an intensely polarized political environment that distrust of mainstream media will make it less likely that Trump supporters - and the Republican officeholders who rely on their votes - will abandon the president any time soon. â€œThe more negativity, the more weâ€™re for him. Itâ€™s backfiring on them,â€?Arizona resident Nadia Larsen said of media reports about possible collusion with Russia or Trumpâ€™s conversations with then-FBI Director James Comey. Reports from the Washington Post and New York Times that Trump shared classified information with Russiaâ€™s foreign minister and pressured Comey to end an inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn have been met with skepticism by Larsen and many other Trump supporters. More credible, they say, is news from prominent conservative media outlets, from the Trump-friendly airwaves of Fox News to websites such as Breitbart. Those outlets have cast the allegations as an ideological attack by Obama administration holdovers or the revenge of the â€œdeep state,â€?a term used by the far right to refer to what they see as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy opposed to Trump. â€œThe only news I watch is Fox, but the only news I watch and believe is whatever comes out of the presidentâ€™s mouth and whatever he tweets,â€?said Larsen, an Israeli-born immigrant who has lived in Tucson, Arizona, for 25 years. Several Trump supporters decried what they described as baseless news from anonymous sources and said they have not seen any concrete evidence to support the allegations against Trump. â€œThis is what I expected,â€?said Jeff Klusmeier, an insurance agent in Louisville, Kentucky. â€œI expected the media to attack Trump. I expected the Democrats to attack him and call for impeachment. So itâ€™s par for the course for me.â€?Conservative media outlets have developed their own theories about the recent spate of negative headlines. The Breitbart News Network, once headed by Trump chief strategist Stephen Bannon, reported that some of the recent accusations were driven by associates of Comey, who was fired by Trump last week, in a story headlined â€œComey Strikes Back.â€?Among the headlines on the Drudge Report, a popular conservative news aggregator, were â€œMedia Reach Peak Meltdownâ€?and â€œSabotage in DC.â€?â€œThe anti-Trump press believes it smells blood in the water,â€?said Fox News commentator Sean Hannity, a staunch Trump supporter who accused the mainstream media of â€œhyperventilating breathlessness.â€?Hannity tweeted on Wednesday that five groups were trying to destroy Trump: the media, Democrats, deep state/intelligence operatives, establishment Republicans and â€œnever Trumpers.â€?â€œThis effort, this plan, this desire to upend and stop the Trump presidency got going probably on election night and certainly within 24 hours. And now weâ€™re seeing it manifest itself,â€?radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh said. On Wednesday, the Justice Department appointed former FBI head Robert Mueller as a special counsel to investigate possible ties between Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Trump has fed the theory that the media is out to get him, saying â€œno politician in historyâ€?has been treated more unfairly. On Thursday he tweeted that the probe of Russian collusion was â€œthe single greatest witch huntâ€?in U.S. history. â€œThe overwhelming majority of conservatives and Republicans believe that whatever you may think of Donald Trump, this is clearly being driven by many quarters of the media that chose sides in the election and were very upfront about it and havenâ€™t changed,â€?Republican consultant Keith Appell told Reuters. Trumpâ€™s approval ratings have been low for a new president, remaining mired in the high 30s to low 40s. But 77 percent of Republicans approve of Trumpâ€™s performance, according to the most recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, a figure that has stayed relatively steady since his inauguration. Bradd Bostick, a Reynoldsburg, Ohio, resident who started a Bikers for Trump group after the presidentâ€™s inauguration in January, said he was not concerned about the recent controversies because â€œmost of us do not believe anything we hear in the mainstream media.â€?â€œThe media thinks itâ€™s about Trump, and itâ€™s not,â€?said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based commentator for Conservative Review and a former talk-radio host who has been critical of Trump. â€œItâ€™s not about Trumpâ€™s credibility, itâ€™s about the mediaâ€™s credibility.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0251,Democratic attorneys general seek to intervene in Obamacare case,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a dozen Democratic attorneys general on Thursday sought to intervene to defend a key part of the Obamacare healthcare law - subsidy payments to insurance companies - which is under threat in a court case. The 16 attorneys general, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, filed a motion to intervene in the case pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case, which dates back to the Obama administration, was filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives against the federal government in an effort to cut off subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. The subsidies payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. â€œThe stakes are very high. In Maryland we have more than 400,000 people who depend on the Affordable Care Act to get normal healthcare. It sounds alarming, but itâ€™s true: lives are at stake,â€?said Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who signed on to the filing. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers, which amount to about $7 billion this year, and referred to them as a â€œbailout.â€? The attorneys general cited in the court filing Trumpâ€™s own words vowing to let Obamacare â€œexplodeâ€?as part of the reasoning for their intervention. Trump has made it clear he views decisions on health insurance for millions of Americans â€œas little more than political bargaining chips,â€?the court filing said. The situation is extremely urgent, the Democratic officials argued, because state insurance regulators are making critical choices that will shape their insurance markets for the next year. Several insurers, including Aetna (AET.N) and Humana (HUM.N), have largely left the Obamacare exchanges, citing a pool of patients who are sicker than expected and therefore more expensive. Insurers have also repeatedly called on the Trump administration to fund the cost-sharing subsidies.  Attorneys general and proponents of Obamacare have said the threats to withhold the payments have already wreaked havoc in the marketplaces and are part of the reason some healthcare consumers have seen double-digit rate increases.  Democratic attorneys general have emerged as significant opponents to the Trump administration. They took a lead role to successfully block Trumpâ€™s executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and they are also resisting efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The attorney general from Kentucky, a deeply conservative state, is among those Democrats joining the court filing even as the stateâ€™s Republican governor has pledged to rollback a Medicaid expansion made possible by Obamacare.  In May 2016, a U.S. judge ruled in favor of the Republicans in the subsidies case, finding that the Obama administration needed explicit congressional approval. The Obama administration appealed before Trump took office, leaving the new administration to ponder how to proceed. The appeals court put the litigation on hold after the November presidential election at the request of the Republican House lawmakers.  The motion to intervene may not be granted by the court. In February, the same court rejected a similar motion filed by Democratic attorneys general seeking to help defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a legal battle that could defang the agency. The litigation could become moot if Congress passes new healthcare legislation to replace Obamacare. The House passed a bill, called the American Health Care Act, earlier this month. The Senate recently began writing its own version of the bill but has warned it could take months to pass.  The Trump administration has taken action over the past several months to undercut Obamacare through regulatory authority. It backed off enforcing the individual mandate, which requires everyone to purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty, tightened enrollment in Obamacare markets and has enabled people to sign up for insurance plans outside of healthcare.gov, the flagship site of Obamacare that the Obama administration heavily advertised.

0252,Treasury's Mnuchin concerned about alternate scoring models of Trump tax plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Thursday that he has some doubts that what are known as alternate scoring models will give enough credit to the potential for economic growth when assessing the impact of the Trump administrationâ€™s tax plan. In late April, the administration put out a one-page overview of its tax reform plans, which would cut taxes for  businesses to 15 percent, as well as cutting taxes and simplifying income tax brackets for individuals. Critics questioned how the tax cuts would be offset without driving up the federal deficit. â€œWhat I have said repeatedly is that any plan we put forward we believe should be paid for with economic growth,â€?Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee. â€œI am concerned as to whether some of the models will attribute enough growth in dynamic scoring but when we present the details we will present how we think it should be paid for.â€?Mnuchin has said the April plan was deliberately vague in order to allow the White House to more effectively work with lawmakers to come up with a joint agreement that could pass Congress. How to pay for the tax cuts remains a sticking point. Fiscal conservatives in the Republican-controlled Congress would strongly prefer a revenue-neutral plan as they are against increasing deficits. Mnuchin has said the cuts would pay for themselves under a dynamic scoring model analysis, which takes into account the effect of tax changes on economic growth and revenue. At Thursdayâ€™s hearing, Mnuchin was also peppered by Democrats on the committee about details of the tax plan, including whether or not cuts would mostly benefit the wealthy. â€œI can assure you the presidentâ€™s objective and my objective is we create a middle income tax cut and we do not raise taxes on the middle income, if anything the opposite,â€?Mnuchin said. He added that the plan would get rid of almost every single tax deduction, which he said were disproportionately used by the wealthy and that the aim was that 95 percent of Americans would no longer need to itemize deductions. Later on Thursday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, the Treasury secretary insisted that tax reforms remain on track despite growing doubts among investors on the size and scope of any cuts achievable in Congress. A renewed push on a repeal of Obamacare is currently being worked on in the Senate while reports that President Donald Trump may have tried to interfere with a federal investigation has shifted focus away from the congressional agenda. â€œI am still very hopeful that weâ€™ll get tax reform done this year,â€?Mnuchin said.",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0253,U.S. Treasury vows no special treatment for Trump in investment reviews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday pledged to treat â€œvery seriouslyâ€?any business dealings President Donald Trump or his family might have with foreign companies flagged by officials as national security risks. Mnuchin did not say any such cases existed. A senior Democrat pressed Mnuchin, in an appearance before senators, to produce a list of the Trump familyâ€™s business relationships with foreign companies.  Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said Mnuchin had not adequately responded to his March 2 letter asking if the Treasury had a list of Trumpâ€™s business partners to see if any of them were on sanctions lists or had been investigated by a national security watchdog that analyzes foreign investments. The Treasury released a copy of a March 31 letter responding to Brown which said the department works with other agencies â€œto address and mitigate potential conflicts of interest if and when they arise.â€?Mnuchin said he reviewed cases at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) every week. The Treasury is the lead department among the government agencies that are part of CFIUS.  â€œI can assure you that if there were any cases that involve the president or any members of his family that they would be treated very seriously. We would review them as we would anything else,â€?Mnuchin told the Senate panel. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, has declined to sell his global businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid conflicts of interest. Trump has said his two oldest sons will have daily control of his businesses while he is president.  A Reuters review in March found that at least 63 individuals with Russian passports or addresses have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida.

0254,Treasury Secretary says Trump has approved new bank regulator,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has made his selection for the next full-time head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Testifying before lawmakers on Thursday, Mnuchin did not name the person tapped for the job, but said the decision had been made and the individual is going through background checks before a formal announcement. The comptroller position is currently being filled in an acting capacity by Keith Noreika, an attorney whom Mnuchin named as interim head earlier in May. Noreika replaced Thomas Curry, who had served as comptroller under President Obama. â€œWe actually have someone the president has approved that is going through the FBI vetting process,â€?Mnuchin said. â€œThis is a time-consuming process.â€? Joseph Otting, who formerly worked as a banking executive at  OneWest bank, which Mnuchin once headed, is believed to be the favorite for the position.        Mnuchin said that an OCC pick had been made in response to criticism from Democrats, who objected to Trump installing a new bank regulator on an interim basis who was not confirmed by the Senate. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland questioned whether this approach was to skirt Senate approval. But Mnuchin insisted Noreika was put in place simply to get someone in the post while a permanent nominee was selected. The Comptrollerâ€™s office writes money-laundering rules, bank charters and closely monitors banksâ€?lending activities. ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0255,Democratic senator tussles with U.S. Treasury secretary over communication,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committeeâ€™s top Democrat tussled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing on Thursday over the flow of information from his agency, and later asked if President Donald Trump, a Republican, had ordered him to restrain communications with Democrats. â€œAre you aware of any White House guidance formal or informal urging administration officials not to respond to or to delay in responding to Democratic senators?â€?Senator Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat, asked Mnuchin toward the end of the hearing. â€œI am not,â€?Mnuchin answered. Brown said earlier in the hearing that he had written to Mnuchin on March 2 asking about â€œpotential conflicts of interest and ownership in the administration,â€?but did not receive a response. He then pressed Mnuchin to send the committee â€œa complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties.â€? Mnuchin said that before the hearing he had checked that Treasury staff â€œhad fully responded to all the inquiries from you and the committeeâ€?and asked Brown to send a note reminding him to deliver the list. While other senators began questioning Mnuchin, the two took the argument off-line, with Treasury emailing reporters a brief statement saying that it had responded to Brownâ€™s letter on March 31. Brownâ€™s office then circulated the response it had received, which generally discussed compliance with conflict of interest laws and lacked any details. Brownâ€™s office said Treasuryâ€™s brief letter had not answered his questions. The senator also did not seem reassured that Treasury was not dragging its feet in communicating with Democrats. After he asked about possible guidance from the White House, Brown pressed: â€œWill you commit to responding to...members of both parties of this committee in a timely manner to all requests for information?â€?â€œI will,â€?Mnuchin responded. A Treasury spokesman did not replay to questions about any formal or informal White House orders on communication. ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0256,Trump administration starts countdown to NAFTA talks in mid-August,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday set the clock ticking toward a mid-August start of renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico to try to win better terms for U.S. workers and manufacturers. With a letter to U.S. lawmakers, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he triggered a 90-day consultation period with Congress, industries and the American public that would allow talks over one of the worldâ€™s biggest trading blocs to begin by Aug. 16. Renegotiation of NAFTA was a key campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump, who frequently called the 23-year-old trade pact a â€œdisasterâ€?that has drained U.S. factories and well-paid manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Trump has pledged to use the NAFTA talks to shrink goods trade deficits that stood at $63 billion with Mexico and $11 billion with Canada last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Lighthizer told reporters NAFTA has been successful for U.S. agriculture, investment services and the energy sector, but not for manufacturing. He added that he hopes to complete negotiations by the end of 2017. â€œAs a starting point for negotiations, we should build on what has worked in NAFTA and change and improve what has not,â€?Lighthizer said in a conference call with reporters. â€œIf renegotiations result in a fairer deal for American workers there is value in making the transition to a modernized NAFTA as seamless as possible.â€?In his letter to congressional leaders, Lighthizer said  NAFTA needs modernization for provisions on digital trade,  intellectual property rights, labor and environmental standards, regulatory practices, rules for state-owned enterprises and food safety standards. The Obama administration attempted to address many of these deficiencies in the 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which included Canada and Mexico, but Trump pulled out of TPP in one of his first official acts as president.  Canada and Mexico both welcomed the U.S. move to launch a NAFTA revamp. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, speaking at a news conference with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington, said the trade pact needed updating after nearly 25 years. â€œThe world has changed, weâ€™ve learned a lot and we can make it better,â€?he said. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada was â€œsteadfastly committed to free trade in the North American region,â€?noting that 9 million U.S. jobs depend on trade and investment with Canada. U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Thomas Donohue urged U.S. officials to â€œdo no harmâ€?to businesses that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico and to move quickly on a new trilateral deal. As the administration took its first formal step toward NAFTA renegotiations, the U.S. Commerce Department launched an investigation on Thursday into Boeing Coâ€™s (BA.N) anti-dumping claims against Canadian rival Bombardierâ€™s (BBDb.TO) new CSeries jetliners, drawing a threat from Canada to review a deal to buy Boeing fighter jets. Lighthizer's letter (here%20Notification.pdf) is less detailed than a draft sent to lawmakers in March, which listed as objectives tax equality and the ability to reimpose tariffs if Mexican and Canadian imports pose a serious injury threat to U.S. industry. Trump late in April had considered a full withdrawal from NAFTA, but was persuaded by senior officials in his administration to pursue negotiations instead. Lighthizer said he did not think a new threat to withdraw from NAFTA would be necessary. â€œAs the president has said, we are going to give renegotiation a good strong shot,â€?Lighthizer told reporters, adding that he believed Canada and Mexico would negotiate in good faith. He said he hoped to maintain the current trilateral format of NAFTA, but noted that many of NAFTAâ€™s problems are bilateral issues that need to be worked out with either Mexico or Canada. â€œOur hope is that we can end up with the structure similar to what we have now. If that should prove to be impossible, then weâ€™ll move in a different direction.â€?Asked if the NAFTA talks would seek to resolve trade disputes over imports of Canadian softwood lumber or Mexican sugar, Lighthizer said he hoped those issues would be settled before the NAFTA talks begin under separate negotiations being conducted by the U.S. Commerce Department. A Canadian source close to the lumber negotiations said it was unlikely an agreement could be reached by mid-August, however. Lighthizer said he will seek public comment on the NAFTA process and intends to publish negotiating objectives on or about July 16. ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0257,U.S. academic groups oppose Trump's visa-vetting plans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of American academic groups have taken a stance against a Trump administration proposal to toughen scrutiny of some U.S. visa applicants, saying it will have a chilling effect on international students studying in the United States. The U.S. State Department has proposed requiring about 65,000 visa applicants per year who consular officers believe warrant enhanced screening to provide all prior passport numbers, five yearsâ€?worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information. More than 50 academic and educational groups across a range of social and physical sciences and representing college admission counselors and advisers said in a letter to State Department officials on Thursday that the changes would cause â€œuncertainties and confusion,â€?lead to â€œunacceptably long delays in processingâ€?and applies to a â€œvague and ill-definedâ€?class of visa applicants.  â€œWe are very concerned that if the proposed changes are implemented, international undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, and scientific collaborators may be discouraged from coming to the United States,â€?the letter said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. The proposal came earlier this month, as part of a push toward the â€œextreme vettingâ€?sought by President Donald Trump. The State Department has to obtain approval for the new procedures from the Office of Management and Budget due to federal regulations and allow members of the public to comment. (bit.ly/2qydWWY) Of the approximately 200 comments as of Thursday, the vast majority were opposed, with about a dozen in favor. The deadline to comment is midnight on Thursday. The prospect of requiring tens of thousands of applicants to hand over their social media information stirred particular concern among commenters, who said incoming students would be put off by having their social media presence scrutinized.  The State Department said in its proposal that the extra information would allow it to â€œmore rigorously evaluate applicants for terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities.â€?Neil Weissman, interim president of Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, said in a comment on the proposal that the additional criteria will harm the â€œcross-border exchange of ideas.â€?About 10 percent of Dickinsonâ€™s 2,400 students are international, according to its website. Andrea Pietrzyk advises international students at Lewis-Clark State College, a public college in Idaho, and said her school has seen an approximately 50 percent drop in international applicants for the fall semester compared with last year. â€œIf people have the perception that itâ€™s going to be too difficult to get a visa, theyâ€™re not going to want to come,â€?Pietrzyk said. â€œStudents from the Middle East do have concerns about whether or not theyâ€™ll have to show or give up their Facebook passwords.â€?The school had 112 international students in fall 2014, of an overall student body of over 4,300, according to its website. A few people commented in favor of aspects of the proposal, saying they thought it could help protect the United States from terrorism. â€œIt seems reasonable to request records of public social media activity as part of an already rigorous vetting process, especially given the role of social media in recent acts of terror,â€?wrote one anonymous commenter. â€œDefinitely do this!â€?wrote another commentator, who gave his name as Butch Walton. â€œIn this age of terrorism, we need to know as much as possible about who is coming here.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1

Similar legislation has failed in the past. Currently, there are only temporary restrictions on former members of Congress becoming lobbyists. The Center for Responsive Politics has noted that former members often score large-salaried lobbying jobs, sometimes of $1 million or more. The non-partisan group found that just over 51 percent of former members of the 113th Congress (2013-2014) became lobbyists. Besides a lifetime ban on lobbying for current members of Congress, the legislation would require former congressional aides to wait six years instead of one year before engaging in lobbying and require better reporting of lobbying activities.

0259,U.S. lawmaker unveils sweeping Pentagon acquisition reform bill,"(Reuters) - The head of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee introduced legislation on Thursday to cut cost overruns at the Pentagon by overhauling the way it buys everything from common off-the-shelf goods to services and intellectual property. Representative Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican, told reporters, â€œif youâ€™re buying office supplies, you ought to be able to go on Amazon and do it.â€?â€œThe current acquisition process prohibits rapid purchases of goods at the best prices becauseâ€?the Department of Defense is restricted to using expensive and onerous contracting processes, committee aides said in a statement about the bill. Thornberry hopes to spark debate about the initiative and then wrap it into the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a broader bill that sets policy for the Defense Department each year, committee aides told reporters. Thornberry and the committee drafted the legislation after more than a year of examining billions of dollars in cost overruns, schedule delays and other problems that have plagued defense procurement programs. The legislation includes measures that would allow existing business to business e-commerce markets, such as Amazon.com Inc or W W Grainger Inc, to sell the military commercial off-the-shelf products such as staplers or forklifts. This would expand procurement options beyond the Pentagonâ€™s current e-commerce program, EMall. The legislation also aims to make the Defense Departmentâ€™s acquisition system more proactive, agile, transparent and innovative, committee aides said, noting that further measures would be proposed in coming years. This bill would consolidate reporting for services contracts and allow for more transparency and accountability for program managers, committee aids said. In 2015, the Pentagon spent $274 billion on contracts of which $144 billion, about 53 percent, was spent on contracted services. The bill also incentivizes the Pentagon to consider purchasing intellectual property earlier in the acquisition cycle. It was hoped that purchasing intellectual property, such as technical data for missiles, while an acquisition process is still competitive would lead to lower overall costs. Committee aides said the legislation was crafted with input from acquisition officials, industry and outside experts. â€œIt is essential to be more agile in the face of technology that changes to fast and threats that change so fast,â€?Thornberry told reporters.

0262,U.S. executives tell Congress they want permanent tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street and corporate executives urged lawmakers on Thursday to pursue a permanent tax reform package that avoids expanding the federal deficit as a way to drive U.S. economic growth, investment and job creation. At a hearing before the House of Representatives tax committee, businessmen including executives from AT&T Inc (T.N), Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) and S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N), said business needs permanent reforms to enhance certainty for long-term investments that can expand markets, grow jobs and increase wages. â€œI need a permanent tax rate and I need it for at least 10 years,â€?said Emerson Chief Executive David Farr, who is also chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful trade group with 14,000 members.  The endorsement of permanent policy changes could help House Republicans advance their revenue-neutral approach in a tax debate that has spawned calls for deficit-funded tax cuts that would have to expire after a decade under Senate rules. The hearing, the first in a series to be held by the House Ways and Means Committee, was intended to show lawmakers moving forward on tax reform at a time of growing doubts about President Donald Trumpâ€™s ability to overhaul the U.S. tax code this year. Trump officials met this week with leaders from the House and Senate as part of an effort to agree on legislation that could pass Congress. Trump and his fellow Republicans made passing what would be the first major tax reform bill since 1986 a central pledge of last yearâ€™s presidential and congressional campaigns.  But Congress must first enact healthcare legislation. The Senate healthcare debate could drag on through the summer, leaving tax reform for late 2017 or early 2018. Failure could postpone tax reform for years. The business executivesâ€?formula for business tax reform included permanent tax cuts; an end to taxation of foreign profits; immediate expensing for capital investments and strong research incentives.  Farr also said he backed Trumpâ€™s 15 percent income tax rate for corporations, less than half of the current 35 percent. Democrats blasted Republican reforms as benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and charged the white male executives with representing a narrow segment of America. â€œLook at the panel.

Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eric Swalwell introduced a bill in December 2016 and again in January 2017 seeking to establish a 12-member, bipartisan-appointed, independent commission to investigate. Democrats have been pushing for a special prosecutor or independent investigation of Russia and the election, and possible links between Trumpâ€™s associates and Moscow as the Republican campaigned for president. Russia has denied that it sought to meddle in the U.S. vote, and Trump has pushed back against such assertions. The Republican leaders of the House have not allowed the legislation to move forward, forcing Democrats to use a parliamentary procedure known as a â€œdischarge petitionâ€?aimed at forcing a vote on legislation that would create the commission. â€œSpeaker (Paul) Ryan has shown he has zero, zero, zero appetite for any investigation of President Trump,â€?Cummings told a news conference.

So far, Representative Walter Jones is the only Republican in the House to support the petition, which would not succeed unless 23 members of the party joined all 193 Democrats in signing it. Democrats have used discharge petitions successfully only twice in recent years, most recently for a vote to preserve the export-import bank in 2015. ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1

0271,Former FBI chief Mueller appointed to probe Trump-Russia ties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department, in the face of rising pressure from Capitol Hill, named former FBI chief Robert Mueller on Wednesday as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. The move followed a week in which the White House was thrown into uproar after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Democrats and some of the presidentâ€™s fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of Novemberâ€™s election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks, took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite, move on and refocus on his stalled agenda, a senior White House official said. â€œWe are all in this together,â€?Trump told his team, the official said. Trump said in a statement after the Justice Department announcement he looked forward to a quick resolution. â€œAs I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,â€?he said. Mueller said in a statement tweeted by CBS News: â€œI accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.â€? Trump, who said in a speech earlier on Wednesday that no  politician in history â€œhas been treated worse or more unfairly,â€?has long bristled at the notion that Russia played any role in his election victory. The Russia issue has, however, clouded his early months in office. Moscow has denied the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the campaign. Pressure on the White House intensified after Trump fired Comey, who had been leading a federal probe into the matter, and allegations that Trump had asked Comey to end the FBI investigation into ties between Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Russia. That raised questions about whether the president improperly attempted to interfere with a federal investigation. The issue spilled over onto Wall Street on Wednesday, where the S&P 500 and the Dow had their biggest one-day declines since September as investor hopes for tax cuts and other pro-business policies faded amid the political tumult. The Justice Department announcement came after the market close. â€œMy decision (to appoint a special counsel) is not the finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. I have made no such determination,â€?Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the special counsel. â€œI determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome,â€?he said. Trump heard about Muellerâ€™s appointment from his White House lawyer Don McGahn about 25 minutes before it was made public, the senior White House official said. Trump assembled his inner circle in the Oval Office - Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Preibus, economic adviser Gary Cohn, senior strategist Steve Bannon, and others - and gave them a pep talk, dictating the statement that was soon released. Trump told them the appointment would allow them to refer questions to Mueller, giving them space to focus on policies such as tax reform. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill generally welcomed the Justice Department action and praised Mueller for his integrity, but House and Senate Republican leaders said they would go on with their own investigations of the Russia matter. â€œA special counsel is very much needed in this situation and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has done the right thing,â€?Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he was confident Mueller â€œwill conduct a thorough and fair investigation.â€?A discordant note was sounded by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, who praised Muellerâ€™s credentials but said: â€œI donâ€™t think they should have appointed someone.â€?â€œI have not seen any evidence of actual collusion. Where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute,â€Â Chaffetz told Fox News. Mueller, 72, was decorated as a Marine Corps officer during the Vietnam War. A former federal prosecutor, he is known for his tough, no-nonsense managerial style. Appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, he became FBI director one week before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He was asked by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2011 to stay on for two more years and was replaced by Comey in 2013. Mueller was credited with transforming the FBI, putting more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other U.S. government agencies. Although Mueller will serve at the pleasure of Rosenstein, the job comes with independence and autonomy. Some past independent investigations have stretched for years. Kenneth Starr, who investigated former President Bill Clinton, probed allegations surrounding Clintonâ€™s past real estate deals but later expanded the inquiry into his relations with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky, leading to Clintonâ€™s impeachment by the House. The White House was conducting interviews on Wednesday of candidates to replace Comey as head of the FBI. A senior administration official said former Democratic vice presidential candidate and Senator Joe Lieberman, one of those interviewed by Trump, was among the leading candidates. Trumpâ€™s spokesman, Sean Spicer, said others being interviewed were acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.

0272,Exclusive: Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michael Flynn and other advisers to Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, current and former U.S. officials familiar with the exchanges told Reuters. The previously undisclosed interactions form part of the record now being reviewed by FBI and congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and contacts between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. Six of the previously undisclosed contacts described to Reuters were phone calls between Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and Trump advisers, including Flynn, Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser, three current and former officials said. Conversations between Flynn and Kislyak accelerated after the Nov. 8 vote as the two discussed establishing a back channel for communication between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could bypass the U.S. national security bureaucracy, which both sides considered hostile to improved relations, four current U.S. officials said. In January, the Trump White House initially denied any contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. The White House and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between Kislyak and Trump advisers during that time. The people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far. But the disclosure could increase the pressure on Trump and his aides to provide the FBI and Congress with a full account of interactions with Russian officials and others with links to the Kremlin during and immediately after the 2016 election. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Flynnâ€™s lawyer declined to comment. In Moscow, a Russian foreign ministry official declined to comment on the contacts and referred Reuters to the Trump administration. Separately, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Washington said: â€œWe do not comment on our daily contacts with the local interlocutors.â€?The 18 calls and electronic messages took place between April and November 2016 as hackers engaged in what U.S. intelligence concluded in January was part of a Kremlin campaign to discredit the vote and influence the outcome of the election in favor of Trump over his Democratic challenger, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Those discussions focused on mending U.S.-Russian economic relations strained by sanctions imposed on Moscow, cooperating in fighting Islamic State in Syria and containing a more assertive China, the sources said. Members of the Senate and House intelligence committees have gone to the CIA and the National Security Agency to review transcripts and other documents related to contacts between Trump campaign advisers and associates and Russian officials and others with links to Putin, people with knowledge of those investigations told Reuters. The U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. Mueller will now take charge of the FBI investigation that began last July. Trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. In addition to the six phone calls involving Kislyak, the communications described to Reuters involved another 12 calls, emails or text messages between Russian officials or people considered to be close to Putin and Trump campaign advisers. One of those contacts was by Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch and politician, according to one person with detailed knowledge of the exchange and two others familiar with the issue. It was not clear with whom Medvedchuk was in contact within the Trump campaign but the themes included U.S.-Russia cooperation, the sources said. Putin is godfather to Medvedchukâ€™s daughter. Medvedchuk denied having any contact with anyone in the Trump campaign. â€œI am not acquainted with any of Donald Trumpâ€™s close associates, therefore no such conversation could have taken place,â€?he said in an email to Reuters. In the conversations during the campaign, Russian officials emphasized a pragmatic, business-style approach and stressed to Trump associates that they could make deals by focusing on common economic and other interests and leaving contentious issues aside, the sources said. Veterans of previous election campaigns said some contact with foreign officials during a campaign was not unusual, but the number of interactions between Trump aides and Russian officials and others with links to Putin was exceptional. â€œItâ€™s rare to have that many phone calls to foreign officials, especially to a country we consider an adversary or a hostile power,â€?Richard Armitage, a Republican and former deputy secretary of state, told Reuters. Beyond Medvedchuk and Kislyak, the identities of the other Putin-linked participants in the contacts remain classified and the names of Trump advisers other than Flynn have been â€œmaskedâ€?in intelligence reports on the contacts because of legal protections on their privacy as American citizens. However, officials can request that they be revealed for intelligence purposes. U.S. and allied intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely monitor communications and movements of Russian officials. After Vice President Mike Pence and others had denied in January that Trump campaign representatives had any contact with Russian officials, the White House later confirmed that Kislyak had met twice with then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general. Kislyak also attended an event in April where Trump said he would seek better relations with Russia. Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, also attended that event in Washington. In addition, Kislyak met with two other Trump campaign advisers in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations with Kislyak in late December - after the Nov. 8 election and just after the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia. Flynn offered to testify to Congress in return for immunity from prosecution but his offer was turned down by the House intelligence committee. ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1

Saudi Arabia has been enthusiastic about Trumpâ€™s arrival at the White House after seeing his predecessor Barack Obama as too soft on its arch foe Iran and cool toward Washingtonâ€™s bilateral relationship with Riyadh that is a mainstay of the Middle Eastâ€™s security balance. Trumpâ€™s visit to Riyadh, the first stop on his maiden international trip since taking office in January, will include concluding political and commercial agreements with Saudi Arabia, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said. â€œIt will bolster the strategic partnership between the two countries,â€?he told a news conference. â€œSaudi Arabia agrees with the U.S. administrationâ€™s view in relation to the role of the United States in the world and in relation to uprooting terrorism,â€?he added, referring to the hardline Islamic State group and al Qaeda. Jubeir said Riyadh and Washington were discussing several â€œinitiativesâ€?related to arms sales, economic and security cooperation and tackling terrorism. â€œSeveral agreements will be signed, whether political agreements... and big economic agreements,â€?he said. Riyadh backs Trumpâ€™s efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also agrees with Washington on  â€œconfronting Iranâ€™s aggressive policies and its support for terrorismâ€? he said. Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances that the Trump administration will continue its harsher tone towards Iran and keep up pressure, through both rhetoric and action, to stop what Riyadh sees as Tehranâ€™s destabilizing activities in the region. The Trump administration has heavily criticized the Westâ€™s nuclear agreement with Iran that was backed by Obama. Senior  administration officials have also criticized Iranâ€™s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its ballistic missile activities and backing for militant groups in the region. Apart from Saudi officials, Trump will also meet leaders of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and have lunch with leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia will use the opportunity of this gathering to increase cooperation with countries opposing Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, Jubeir said. Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was not concerned about sharing intelligence with the United States, despite a storm over reports that Trump had discussed intelligence with Russia during a White House meeting last week. â€œWe share a very, very large amount of intelligence with the United States and vice versa,â€?Jubeir said. â€œWe have had no hesitation about doing so and we will not have any hesitation about continuing to do so.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1

0280,"Embroiled in controversies, Trump seeks boost on foreign trip","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Besieged by controversy at home, U.S. President Donald Trump is under pressure to stick to the script and avoid fresh flare-ups when he embarks this week on his first foreign trip, a nine-day trek to the Middle East and Europe. White House officials and Republicans close to the administration say Trump, who campaigned on an â€œAmerica Firstâ€?slogan, wants to demonstrate leadership abroad on his visit with Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Israel and the West Bank, the pope at the Vatican, NATO leaders in Brussels and G7 counterparts in Sicily. Trump faces fierce criticism over his sharing of sensitive national security information with Russian officials and his firing last week of FBI Director James Comey. Allegations that he previously asked Comey to end an investigation into his former national security adviser drew a new round of attacks on Tuesday. A Republican strategist close to the White House said Trump needed a strong trip to help put the past tumultuous 10 days behind him. â€œIf the White House is looking for this international trip to turn the page, then it really needs to come off well without any balls dropped or serious mistakes,â€?said the strategist, who requested anonymity. â€œThis is their time to shine, to show Americans and the world that the White House isnâ€™t becoming a circus of errors.â€?Airing his frustrations on Twitter, Trump has lashed out at leaks to the news media from officials inside his administration. Confidants say a staff shake-up is possible, although major changes are unlikely before Trumpâ€™s foreign trip. His political woes will add to Trumpâ€™s challenges as he tries to bolster ties abroad. â€œThis trip combines so many different things and actors that the question is going to be whatâ€™s the message that he wants to communicate when heâ€™s out there,â€?said Lanhee Chen, who advised Republican Mitt Romneyâ€™s presidential campaign in 2012 and Marco Rubioâ€™s in 2016. Some doubt whether Trump, a businessman-turned politician who never held elective office before becoming president in January, is ready for a smooth presidential debut abroad. One Republican official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said after meeting Trump recently he did not think  the president had a firm enough grasp on the nuances of the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. â€œI donâ€™t think he understands it,â€?said the official, adding that Trump needed more detailed briefings before leaving on Friday. â€œI think itâ€™s a very difficult challenge and I hope heâ€™s going to talk to a lot of smart people.â€?White House advisers insisted Trump was up to speed on the Middle East, having already hosted Arab, Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the White House. â€œHis way of doing diplomacy, which really contrasts with President Obamaâ€™s approach, is to ... prioritize the personal relationship,â€?said Michael Singh, a foreign policy adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush. To prepare for his trip, Trump has been meeting with briefers including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Conversations with some officials who have briefed Trump and others who are aware of how he absorbs information portray a president with a short attention span. He likes single-page memos and visual aids like maps, charts, graphs and photos. National Security Council officials have strategically included Trumpâ€™s name in â€œas many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if heâ€™s mentioned,â€?according to one source, who relayed conversations he had with NSC officials. Trump likes to look at a map of the country involved when he learns about a topic. â€œHe likes to visualize things,â€?said a senior administration official. â€œThe guyâ€™s a builder. He has spent his whole life looking at architectural renderings and floor plans.â€?Although Trump has a string of golf resorts around the world that he has visited, the trip could take him out of his comfort zone. He generally prefers his own bed to hotel rooms. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he often flew home after a day of campaigning rather than staying in hotels overnight. Presidential rhetoric and gaffes abroad have caused  problems for some of Trumpâ€™s predecessors. Bush drew fire after his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Slovenia in June 2001, when he said he had looked the former KGB chief in the eye and â€œI was able to get a sense of his soul.â€?The comment was seen as naive. Even body language is watched carefully. Democratic President Barack Obama was criticized for bowing to Japanese Emperor Akihito in a visit to Japan in November 2009. One Gulf Arab official said Trumpâ€™s decision to make Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, the first stop on his trip would send a message that America did not see Islam as an enemy. Â Â Â  The trip could be a chance for the president to counter critics who accuse him of being anti-Muslim because of the order he issued, now blocked by U.S. courts, temporarily banning entry into the United States by citizens of several Muslim-majority countries. Â Â Â  But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that if Trump, who is prone to speaking off-the-cuff, ended up undercutting his own message, it could be damaging. â€œIt can backfire, I mean it can seriously backfire,â€?the official said. Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to Bush, said that since the trip would be Trumpâ€™s first overseas, the stakes were higher. â€œThe meaning and importance of his first trip abroad will be exaggerated, but it gives him a chance to get bipartisan accolades, or a chance to fail badly and have the failure exaggerated,â€?Fleischer said.

0281,What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign to benefit Trump. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a â€œclear preferenceâ€?for Trump to win the White House. Putinâ€™s  associates hacked information, paid social media â€œtrollsâ€?and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. What has Trump said about Russiaâ€™s role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  â€œI will tell you this, Russia: if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,â€?Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. â€œAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,â€?Trump said, although he added: â€œIt could have been others also.â€?Earlier this month, Trump said China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. How many U.S. probes are there into Russiaâ€™s election meddling?  The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI, which is investigating, to handle any related criminal prosecutions.   Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate are also investigating and those probes will continue. Comey has been invited to testify about the agencyâ€™s Russia investigation and his dismissal.  Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts  with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, was fired  in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the  first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn after he declined to voluntarily comply with an earlier request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy U.S. attorney general, is handling matters related to Russia; he appointed Mueller as special counsel. Will the FBI probe continue after Comeyâ€™s dismissal? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscowâ€™s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. It was the first time he publicly acknowledged the agency was investigating the matter. Comeyâ€™s departure does not necessarily mean the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation will be disrupted or ended as the career FBI officials Comey put in charge of it will likely continue working on the matter even as the search for a new director begins. FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who will lead the agency until a new director is named, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeyâ€™s firing will not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Why was Comey fired? Attorney General Sessions sent Trump a May 9 letter attaching a memo from Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on â€œRestoring Confidence in the FBIâ€?that recommended Comeyâ€™s dismissal. Rosensteinâ€™s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteinâ€™s view was that Comeyâ€™s decision to make a public statement on the matter broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a â€œshowboatâ€?and â€œgrandstanderâ€?in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteinâ€™s recommendation.  Did Comeyâ€™s firing have anything to do with the Russia probe? The White House says Comey was dismissed because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation.  The New York Times was the first to report, on May 16, that a memo Comey wrote after a February meeting with Trump stated that the president had asked him to end the FBIâ€™s investigation of Flynn. Trump aides have told Reuters that top Justice Department officials wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say during a May 3 congressional hearing about the FBIâ€™s investigation of Clintonâ€™s private email system.  The hearing was just days after Clinton said at a New York event that announcements by Comey in the week before the November election that he had re-opened, and then re-closed, the email probe had swung the election for Trump. Comey told the congressional panel the idea that he may have affected the election result made him â€œmildly nauseous.â€?Is Trump being investigated by the FBI?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has never stated publicly whether or not the FBI was investigating Trump and it would be unorthodox for him to say such a thing to the president. The White House has offered no proof to back Trumpâ€™s claim. News of Comeyâ€™s memo, along with a Washington Post report on May 15 that Trump had revealed classified info during a May 10 meeting at the White House with Russian officials, intensified calls from Democrats and some Republicans for an independent probe of Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. â€œThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?â€?he wrote on Twitter on May 8.

0282,Special prosecutor creation seen easing U.S. Congress partisanship: Senator Cornyn,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Departmentâ€™s decision to name a special prosecutor to investigate Russiaâ€™s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections could ease red-hot partisan tensions in Congress, Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday. Cornyn, speaking to reporters immediately after ex-FBI Director Robert Mueller was named as the special prosecutor, also said the announcement could make it easier for the Senate to confirm President Donald Trumpâ€™s replacement of fired FBI Director James Comey and said former Senator Joe Lieberman would get widespread support among the 100 senators for confirmation, if he were to be nominated.

0283,House leader McCarthy suggested Trump on Putin payroll: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading Republican in the U.S. Congress in June 2016 made a quip during a private meeting of fellow lawmakers that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be making payments to Donald Trump, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made the assertion, the newspaper reported, saying the conversation was recorded last June, during the primary election season when Trump was seeking to become the Republican Partyâ€™s presidential nominee. According to the Washington Post report, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, interrupted McCarthy and urged Republicans present to keep McCarthyâ€™s remarks secret. The newspaper report quoted McCarthy saying, â€œThereâ€™s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.â€?McCarthy fired back at the report on Twitter on Wednesday, saying, â€œThis was an attempt at humor gone wrong.â€?A spokesman for Ryan said the remarks were meant as humor and had been taken out of context.  â€œThis entire year-old exchange was clearly an attempt at humor. No one believed the majority leader was seriously asserting that Donald Trump or any of our members were being paid by the Russians,â€?Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said. Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher on Wednesday told reporters that McCarthyâ€™s quip was a joke. â€œThe trouble is, when you ever try to be funny, it is really taken seriously by a third party, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happened here,â€?he said.      Reuters does not have a copy of the tape and could not confirm authenticity or gauge whether McCarthy was joking. ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0284,Factbox: Ex-FBI Director Mueller draws praise as special counsel on Russia probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday generally approved of the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate possible connections between President Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign team and Russia. Committees in the House and the Senate will continue their own investigations while Mueller leads the Justice Departmentâ€™s probe. Muellerâ€™s appointment comes after the administration was rocked by reports that Trump asked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Mike Flynn, who resigned amid allegations of contacts with Russia. Trump fired Comey last week. Below are reactions to the Mueller appointment: â€œAs I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity.Â I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.â€?- Trump in a statement â€œA special prosecutor is the first step but it cannot be the last. Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice Department. He cannot take the place of a truly independent, outside commission that is completely free from the Trump administrationâ€™s meddling.â€?- Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi in a statement â€œI donâ€™t think they should have appointed someone ... Where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute? ... What I worry is Democrats are going to politically exploit this on a daily drumbeat.â€?- Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee investigating Russian influence, in a Fox News interview in which he also praised Muellerâ€™s â€œimpeccable credentials.â€?â€œI think the president ought to now back off and let the justice system proceed as it proceeds in all cases. I think tweeting about the process of the investigation is not helpful and again, I think if he has done nothing wrong there will be no problem.â€?- Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings to reporters â€œThis had gotten too political. Any news comes out, those on the left yell impeach, some on the right say itâ€™s fake. So this hopefully detoxes some of the politics.â€? - Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger to reporters â€œItâ€™s fine but thereâ€™s absolutely no need for it...In Watergate, there was a crime. In the (Monica) Lewinsky case, there was a crime. Thereâ€™s no crime here.â€?- Republican Representative Peter King to Politico â€œHopefully, he (Mueller) will be seen as someone that both Democrats and Republicans can support. I think itâ€™s a prudent move. And it certainly means that the administration is taking it seriously.â€?- Republican Representative Mark Meadows to reporters â€œThis must only be a first step. No doubt this investigation should extend to the circumstances that led to the presidentâ€™s abrupt dismissal of James Comey and to other critical matters that arise.â€?- Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy â€œI would hope that the people here (in Congress) will believe if a special prosecutor tells them that thereâ€™s no indication that the Russians have done anything here, that they will finally open their eyes, and say, â€˜Thereâ€™s no there, there.â€™â€?- Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher to Reuters â€œThe appointment of former FBI director and respected lawyer Robert Mueller ... is a positive development and will provide some certainty for the American people that the investigation will proceed fairly and free of political influence.â€?- Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner, leading members of the Senate committee investigating Russian influence, in a statement ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0285,'Bobby Three Sticks' Mueller to probe Russia-Trump imbroglio,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI director and prosecutor Robert Mueller, known for his independence in high-profile government investigations, is taking on a new challenge in the midst of a crisis that threatens the presidency of the United States. Mueller, 72, was named on Wednesday by the Justice Department to probe alleged Russian efforts to sway Novemberâ€™s presidential election in favor of Donald Trump and to investigate whether there was any collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign team and Moscow. President Trump said in a statement there was no collusion between his campaign and â€œany foreign entity.â€? Mueller is known by some as â€œBobby Three Sticksâ€?because of his full name - Robert Mueller III - a moniker that belies the formal bearing and no-nonsense style of the former Marine Corps officer who was decorated during the Vietnam War. Democrats and Republicans alike praised his appointment and hailed his integrity and reputation. Mueller was named to the post by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. His investigation will run in parallel to those being carried out by the FBI and the U.S. Congress. It would be difficult to fire Mueller, and past special counsel appointments have shown that the job comes with independence and autonomy. Chicago federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed during the George W. Bush administration in 2003 to a similar role to investigate the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame, an undercover CIA officer whose husband had criticized Bush administration policies. Fitzgerald indicted I. Lewis â€œScooterâ€?Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. Bush granted Libby clemency from a prison sentence before he left office. Robert Luskin, a Washington lawyer who defended Bush political adviser Karl Rove during Fitzgeraldâ€™s investigation, praised the choice of Mueller. â€œI think itâ€™s good across the board,â€?Luskin told Reuters. He described Mueller as â€œcredibleâ€?and â€œindependentâ€?and said his appointment would be â€œgood for the Department of Justice.â€?Mueller, known for avoiding political controversy, took a stand in 2004 when he and then-deputy attorney general James Comey threatened to resign when the Bush White House sought to reauthorize a domestic wiretapping program that the Justice Department had deemed unconstitutional. In his new role as special counsel, Mueller will have wide latitude to take the investigation wherever he thinks it should go and can use the full range of Justice Department investigative tools, said Jack Sharman, an attorney who served as special counsel during a probe into the Whitewater real-estate investments of President Bill Clinton in 1995. Mueller was appointed director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by George W. Bush a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.  He was credited with transforming the FBI after Congress and an independent government commission established that the agency and the CIA had failed to share information before the attacks that could have helped thwart them. At the FBI, Mueller put more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other federal agencies. Mueller was chief of the Justice Departmentâ€™s criminal division before becoming FBI director. Among his most famous cases was the fraud and racketeering indictment of individuals associated with a politically connected Luxembourg bank run out of London and led by bankers from Pakistan and Abu Dhabi. He also oversaw the investigation into the Pan Am airline bombing over Scotland and the drug case against former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Mueller served 10 years as FBI chief under Bush and his  Democratic successor Barack Obama, who then signed legislation to extend Muellerâ€™s FBI term for another two years. He was succeeded as FBI director by Comey, who was fired by Trump last week.  In the wake of his firing, there have been media reports that Trump had asked Comey in February to end an FBI investigation into the presidentâ€™s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The reports cited a memo said to have been written by Comey documenting Trumpâ€™s request.  There have been calls for months for a special counsel to oversee the investigation into any ties between Trumpâ€™s campaign team and Moscow. Most recently, Mueller had worked at a major Washington law firm, Wilmer Hale, which presents a possible wrinkle for his new assignment. The firm represents Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have taken on White House jobs. It also represents Paul Manafort, a former campaign chairman who had ties to Russia. Mueller left Wilmer Hale this week but faces a Justice Department ethics requirement that could bar him for a year from investigating anyone represented by his former firm. Mueller may be able to obtain a waiver from the Justice Departmentâ€™s ethics officers or recuse himself from investigating certain individuals, leaving those inquiries to a deputy. Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration who has been a vocal critic of Trump, said Mueller has good grounds to receive such a waiver. ",politicsNews,2017/5/18,1
0286,Republicans worry Trump scandals may doom legislative agenda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scandals enveloping U.S. President Donald Trump have left Republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly gloomy about the prospects for passing sweeping tax cuts, a rollback of Obamacare  and an ambitious infrastructure program. With the White House and both chambers of the U.S. Congress under Republican control, party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans, with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities. But four months into Trumpâ€™s tenure, only limited progress has been made. The House of Representatives passed a measure to rewrite Obamacare, but the Senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue. Lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform. In addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign team and Russia, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the matter. â€œItâ€™s the elephant in the room right now,â€?said Republican Representative Pat Tiberi. â€œThe smartest minds in the White House know that, whether itâ€™s tax reform or anything else on the public policy front. Itâ€™s hard enough to get things done in the U.S. Capitol under the best of circumstances.â€?The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on Thursday. Key administration and congressional leaders met Wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward. But they remain a long way from signing a bill into law. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that â€œless drama from the White Houseâ€?was needed to advance legislative priorities.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Wednesday that the legislative process had â€œpretty much ground to a haltâ€?amid the tumult in Washington. Republican Representative Steve Womack said it was important for committees investigating the Russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for Congress to move on to other issues. â€œAny time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda, it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the American people,â€?Womack said. At a news conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his colleagues to â€œseize this momentâ€?to pass tax reform. But instead of discussing tax rates and structures, Ryan was faced with a series of questions about James Comey, who Trump fired as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week, and the Russia investigation. Several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved.  â€œMy worry level has grown considerably,â€?one lobbyist said. Some lobbyists suggested that Congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for.  â€œWhen this all started, the thing we heard from the Hill was â€˜transformative tax reform,â€™â€?said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform. â€œI think as time passes, tax reform is going to look much different, that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform.â€?

0287,Putin offers transcript to prove Trump did not pass Russia secrets,"SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript. But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply. Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trumpâ€™s tenure. Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians. President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd.  â€œI spoke to him (Lavrov) today,â€?a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. â€œIâ€™ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russiaâ€™s intelligence services. It was very bad of him.â€? Putin, who still hopes Moscow can repair battered ties with the United States despite a deepening political scandal in the United States related to Trumpâ€™s purported Russia ties, said Moscow had rated Lavrovâ€™s meeting with Trump highly. If the Trump administration deemed it appropriate, Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trumpâ€™s meeting with Lavrov to U.S. lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed. A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, later told reporters that Moscow had a written record of the conversation, not an audio recording. U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio was unimpressed with Putinâ€™s offer and alluded to alleged Russian hacking of Democratic groups during the U.S. presidential election.  â€œI wouldnâ€™t put much credibility into whatever Putinâ€™s notes are,â€?Rubio said on Fox News. â€œAnd if it comes in an email, I wouldnâ€™t click on the attachment.â€?Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, called Putinâ€™s offer â€œquite amusing.â€?â€œThe last person Trump needs to vouch for him right now is Vladimir Putin,â€?Schiff said in an interview with CBS News. â€œIf they want to send something, you know, hats off. Send it our way... Itâ€™s credibility would be less than zero.â€?Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. Trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agencyâ€™s investigation into the Russia ties of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The allegation stems from a memo written by Comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo. In Washington, Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the Comey memo. U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger joined a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into Russiaâ€™s role in the 2016 election. â€œIf in fact what was in the memo is true, itâ€™s very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that,â€?Kinzinger said on CNN. Complaining about what he said was â€œpolitical schizophreniaâ€?in the United States, Putin said Trump was not being allowed to do his job properly. â€œItâ€™s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next,â€?said Putin, referring to unnamed U.S. politicians.  â€œWhat surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti-Russian slogans. Either they donâ€™t understand the damage theyâ€™re doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt.â€?    Russia has repeatedly said that Trumpâ€™s opponents are trying to damage him and Moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the Russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement. Officials have told Reuters Trumpâ€™s alleged disclosure of classified information to Russiaâ€™s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating. That view was reinforced on Wednesday when British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government had confidence in its relationship with the United States and would continue to share intelligence with Britainâ€™s most important defense and security ally.

0288,Factbox: U.S. Justice Department's special counsel probe of Russia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey has raised questions about the future of the agencyâ€™s probe into Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had appointed former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to lead an independent probe. Here is what to expect: * The FBIâ€™s investigation will continue.  Comeyâ€™s firing did not end the FBIâ€™s investigation into Moscowâ€™s role in the 2016 election. The career FBI staffers Comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it, legal experts told Reuters, even as the White House interviews new directors. * Probes underway in the U.S. Congress will also continue. Investigations already underway in the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Intelligence Committee and other panels will progress. Congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes even after Muellerâ€™s appointment, experts said. Senate Republicans, including some from leadership, previously argued that the appointment of a special counsel could imperil ongoing congressional probes. Mueller will not have the authority to demand Congress halt a probe. Though criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, legal experts said the complications would be indistinguishable from those created by the already ongoing FBI investigation. * Mueller will steer a parallel probe at the Justice Department.  Mueller will interview relevant witnesses, subpoena documents and, if the evidence merits, work with the FBI to bring criminal charges related to the probe. *Mueller will operate with a high degree of independence from the Trump administration. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to head the departmentâ€™s Russia probe citing department regulations that allow attorney generals to appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government.  The department regulations are â€œnot quite as robustâ€?as a law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor that lapsed in the 1990s, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But â€œthe regulations are designed to give the special counsel a great degree of independence - decisions can be overridden but if they are, to make sure that Congress knows about them,â€?Levitt said. Rosenstein appointed Mueller because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes because he had not told Congress about his own contacts with Russian officials. *It would be difficult to fire Mueller from the job. Only the attorney general - or in this case Rosenstein, as the acting attorney general in matters related to Russia - has the authority to fire a special counsel. Justice Department regulations state that a special counsel can only be removed â€œfor cause,â€?such as misconduct, conflict of interest or dereliction of duty, Levitt said. Though Rosenstein, like Comey, serves at the pleasure of the president and could be removed without cause at any time, Levitt cautioned that doing so in order to jeopardize Muellerâ€™s probe would come at a high political cost. â€œEach of those actions will come with increasing public and congressional scrutiny,â€?Levitt said.

0289,Controversial Milwaukee County sheriff says taking U.S. Homeland Security post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, an African-American who became a staunch critic of the â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€?movement and supported Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, said on Wednesday he has accepted a job as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Clarke told radio station WISN in Milwaukee that he would leave his post as sheriff next month to join the Department of Homeland Security. The post would not require Senate confirmation. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said no announcement on Clarke had been made, and said the role of assistant secretary must be made official by the secretary of the department.  Clarke said on WISNâ€™s Vicki McKenna Show, â€œIâ€™ll be a liaison with state and local governments and with the private sector, and one thatâ€™s really near and dear to me - liaison with the state, local and tribal law enforcement,â€?according to an online recording of the show posted on the stationâ€™s website. Clarkeâ€™s office and spokeswoman in Milwaukee could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. He said on the radio show that he would work with local agencies that can feel neglected or ignored by the federal government. The Department of Homeland Security, created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon, includes agencies that handle customs, border protection and immigration, the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Secret Service. The Black Lives Matter movement grew out of protests over a number of police killings of unarmed black men in various parts of the United States. The movement has challenged the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers.  Clarke has labeled members of the movement â€œsubhuman creepsâ€?and called for its eradication. He spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July. Critics have faulted Clarke for his management of a Milwaukee County jail where a mentally ill man died in 2016 of dehydration. An inquest jury recommended that seven employees of the jail be criminally charged. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California called Clarkeâ€™s appointment â€œa disgrace.â€?â€œSheriff David Clarkeâ€™s unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve,â€?Harris said in a tweet.

0291,U.S. cyber bill would shift power away from spy agency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill proposed in Congress on Wednesday would require the U.S. National Security Agency to inform representatives of other government agencies about security holes it finds in software like the one that allowed last weekâ€™s â€œransomwareâ€?attacks. Under former President Barack Obama, the government created a similar inter-agency review, but it was not required by law and was administered by the NSA itself. The new bill would mandate a review when a government agency discovers a security hole in a computer product and does not want to alert the manufacturer because it hopes to use the flaw to spy on rivals. It also calls for the review process to be chaired by the defense-oriented Department of Homeland Security rather than the NSA, which spends 90 percent of its budget on offensive capabilities and spying. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii introduced the legislation in the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. â€œStriking the balance between U.S. national security and general cyber security is critical, but itâ€™s not easy,â€?said Senator Schatz in a statement. â€œThis bill strikes that balance.â€?Tech companies have long criticized the practice of withholding information about software flaws so they can be used by government intelligence agencies for attacks. Hackers attacked 200,000 in more than 150 countries last week using a Microsoft Windows software vulnerability that had been developed by the NSA and later leaked online. Microsoft President Brad Smith harshly criticized government practices on security flaws in the wake of the ransomware attacks. â€œRepeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage,â€?Smith wrote in a blog post. Agencies like the NSA often have greater incentives to exploit any security holes they find for spying, instead of helping companies protect customers, cyber security experts say.  â€œDo you get to listen to the Chinese politburo chatting and get credit from the president?â€?said Richard Clayton a cyber-security researcher at the University of Cambridge. â€œOr do you notify the public to help defend everyone else and get less kudos?â€?Susan Landau, a cyber security policy expert at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, said that in putting DHS in charge of the process, the new bill was an effort to put the process â€œinto civilian control.â€?The new committeeâ€™s meetings would still be secret. But once a year it would issue a public version of a secret annual report.  The NSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0292,Trexit? Online bettors play early end to Trump presidency,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bettors on both sides of the Atlantic are ramping up wagers in niche online markets over whether Donald Trump will serve out a full term as U.S. president in the wake of controversies surrounding the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. Some, such as the online political stock market PredictIt, have seen record volume during the last two days on contracts focused on whether Trump will be impeached. Others based in the United Kingdom are drawing bets on the less-specific question of whether Trump remains in office until his term expires in January 2021. The contract on PredictIt titled â€œWill Donald Trump be impeached in 2017?â€?saw volume of more than 100,000 contracts in the last 24 hours after reports of a memo written by Comey that said Trump had asked him to end the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia.  At one point early on Wednesday, the price of a â€œyesâ€?contract on the impeachment question jumped to a record 33 cents, implying a 33 percent probability that Trump would be impeached. That compares with only 7 percent just over a week ago. By late in the day, however, the price had slid back to 27 percent, just above where it ended late Tuesday at 24 percent. PredictIt is jointly run by Washington political consultancy Aristotle and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. All of its users are registered U.S. voters. The bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair (PPB.I) (PPB.L) said bettors there had laid out more than 5,000 pounds ($6,470) on an early departure for Trump in the hours after it was reported Trump had asked Comey to shut down the FBIâ€™s investigation of Russia ties. In all, the question of whether Trump will make an early exit has drawn more than $270,000 in wagers, while a related question on whether Trump will leave in 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020 or later has garnered more than $480,000. British betting firm Ladbrokes (LCL.L) cut the price of a Trump impeachment to odds-on at 4-5 from 11-10, equivalent to about 56 percent probability that Trump will be removed from office. â€œPolitical punters are wondering how many more scandals can Trump overcome,â€?said Ladbrokes spokeswoman Jessica Bridge. â€œAnd despite the short price on offer, money has poured in for the president to be impeached, leaving us with little option but to cut the odds.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1

Trump will not be in town for the occasion. He embarks on his first foreign trip on Friday to the Middle East and Europe. White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney revealed the date in a speech to the Federalist Society on Thursday. The White House had released what is known as a â€œskinny budgetâ€?in March, Trumpâ€™s first crack at a summary of his spending wishes for discretionary programs for the year that begins Sept. 30. The plan drew criticism even from members of his own Republican Party for being too severe. Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives. Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidentsâ€?budget plans. A $1.2 trillion federal spending deal for the 2017 fiscal year, passed last month, included about half of the extra military funding that Trump wanted. It included some funds for border security, but no money for Trumpâ€™s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.

0296,"U.S. industry seeks faster permits, simpler rules in Trump regulation reset","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industry groups have told President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration that they want two main things from his promised regulatory overhaul: a speedier permit process and simpler environmental rules. Associations representing the drilling, refining, mining, and building industries have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the Commerce Department and Environmental Protection Agency in recent weeks, outlining regulations they want to see eliminated or modified. The comments, many targeting the EPA, come in response to a pair of executive orders Trump signed during his first weeks in office, meant to cut the regulatory burden on companies. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have already moved to rescind a slew of Obama-era environmental protections, including some aimed at combating global climate change. The EPAâ€™s regulatory reform office alone has received remarks from more than 65,000 people and groups, many of them criticizing the regulatory rollback plan as a potential threat to public health. But business groups have embraced the plan, calling it the best chance in more than a decade to reshape the regulatory landscape and boost growth, without undermining air and water quality. â€œLast time I remember this was 2001. That was the last big opportunity to make some changes,â€?said David Friedman, vice president of regulatory affairs for the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers industry group.  That year, then Vice President Dick Cheney chaired an energy task force that produced a National Energy Policy report, a road map to boosting domestic systems and supplies. Much has changed since: U.S. oil and gas production hit all-time highs during the administration of former President Barack Obama, helped by high crude prices and improved drilling technology. This time around, industry groups appear focused on easing the permitting process for new facilities and installations, according to a Reuters review of the comments. A common refrain, for example, is for Trumpâ€™s administration to reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Actâ€™s National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Several groups said this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for operations and new facilities. Several groups mentioned other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act that they say are redundant. These include the New Source Performance Standards, the Maximum Achievable Control Technology rules and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.  â€œWe have one proposal to replace eight different regulations with one that achieves the same environmental benefit but substantially reduces the cost of compliance,â€?said Rosario Palmieri, vice president for regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.  The American Petroleum Institute representing oil and gas companies and the Edison Electric Institute, representing electric utilities, are seeking changes in the way companies must account for greenhouse gas emissions. Comments from members of the public and environmental groups revealed worries that this process would undermine environmental protections. The EPAâ€™s comment period ended on May 15. Jeff Baker, a military veteran and energy investor from Alabama wrote: â€œI implore you, as defenders of our nationâ€™s health and security, to avoid shortsighted steps that might create prosperity for a few in the short term, at the expense of the many in the long term.â€?Trumpâ€™s administration requested the comments from industry as part of two similar and concurrent processes, stemming from his executive orders.  The first order, issued on Jan. 24, directed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review which U.S. regulations were burdens for domestic manufacturing. The Commerce Department solicited feedback from industry as a result of that order, with a March 31 deadline. Ross told Reuters in an interview last week that the department was condensing the comments into a series of recommendations that could be presented to Trump as early as this month. [nL1N1IB240] The second order was issued Feb. 24, directing all U.S. agency heads to launch a process to identify regulatory burdens. Each agency has its own timetable. The EPA, which is taking the brunt of the feedback, started its public comment period on April 11 and closed it this week. ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0297,Factbox: U.S. industry wish list in Trump regulation overhaul,"(Reuters) - U.S. industry groups have submitted hundreds of pages of recommendations to President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration in recent weeks, detailing ways they think he could ease their regulatory burden. The comments can be found at the following web sites: here and here Here is a selection of some of their suggestions: * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Modify the U.S. Clean Air Actâ€™s Greenhouse Gas Reporting rule to create incentives for carbon capture and storage technology, in which carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored underground. * STACK TESTING - Eliminate redundant stack testing currently required under parts of the U.S. Clean Air Act. * ONCE IN-ALWAYS IN - Eliminate a provision of the U.S. Clean Air Act that requires a major source of emissions to always be treated as a major source, even if it later adds technology to reduce those emissions. This change was also requested by other groups, including the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute. * NEW SOURCE REVIEW - Modify the New Source Review permitting process required under the U.S. Clean Air Act to eliminate the need to consider emissions increases from non-modified affected emission units at a plant, and allow â€œproject nettingâ€?that accounts for emissions reductions elsewhere at a plant. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS - Review an EPA decision to tighten ozone standards in a way that would likely expose more company facilities to tougher Clean Air Act rules. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure average mandated ethanol content in gasoline does not exceed 9.7 percent of projected U.S. demand. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure EPA continues to boost the mandated volumes of biofuels in gasoline and other road fuels. * AIR PERMITS: Reduce the burden of air and ozone permitting regulation to make it easier to greenlight projects. * EPA TRANSPARENCY: Increase the transparency of the science EPA relies upon in its rule-making. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: â€œStreamline specific NSPS and NESHAP regulations to eliminate redundant requirements, conflicts between rules, and undue complexity, resulting in practical and understandable regulations without reduced protection of the environment.â€?* NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Review rules seeking to limit fugitive emissions from oil and gas installations. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Like AFPM and others, IPAA wants a review of planned tightening of ozone standards that could ramp up regulatory burdens.   * MORE COLLABORATIVE ENFORCEMENT: â€œEPA needs to thoroughly review and revise its federal enforcement process. It needs to create an enforcement program that treats the regulated community with fairness, respect and dignity.â€?* NEW SOURCE REVIEW: â€œThere continues to be a need for NSR reforms that simplify and streamline permitting.â€?* NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Review various aspects of ozone standards and enforcement to ease regulatory burdens.  * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Require less frequent, and less arduous reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Reconsider aspects of this regulation, including those requiring a New Source Review permit for a plant undergoing any modification - â€œan enormous additional environmental review process that stifles modernization and efficiency upgrades.â€?* FINANCIAL ASSURANCE FOR HARD ROCK MINING: Eliminate EPA rule that would require an increase in funds available to reclaim post-mining sites. * ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT: Overturn â€œmisuse of the Endangered Species Act which has put 10 million acres across a few western states off limits from mining.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0298,Senate tees up 'accountability act' as regulation fight intensifies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate could soon approve a major overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and make lasting changes to regulation of the environment, education, banks and other areas. On Wednesday a Senate committee sent a bill on to the full chamber that, supporters say, will make regulators more accountable to lawmakers and provide greater understanding of how rules affect the economy.  The next step, debating the bill on the Senate floor, has not been scheduled. The House of Representatives approved companion legislation in January. Critics say the bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, creates so many new requirements that it would paralyze regulators working to establish even the most basic rules and standards. They also say it makes cutting industry and banksâ€?costs a higher priority than protecting public health and safety. For decades the political parties have been starkly divided over regulation and Republicans are currently winning their battle to lessen the red tape they say ties up business and hurts the economy. Republicans also say former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, pushed regulators to go beyond their duties of executing laws passed by Congress to create policy on their own.  Democrats say regulation, which touches nearly every part of American life, shields average people from health, financial and other threats and is needed to accomplish the goals set in laws. The Senate bill would require more cost-benefit and other analyses, give courts and the White House greater checks on rulemaking, classify regulations by potential economic impact, and lengthen rulemaking processes.  One progressive group, Public Citizen, estimates it would add 53 steps to major rulemaking, possibly doubling the average amount of time it takes to finalize a regulation - currently four years. The bill has pitted the powerful business group, the Chamber of Commerce, against progressive ones such as the Natural Resources Defense Council. Senator Heidi Heitkamp broke ranks with her fellow Democrats to write the accountability act, indicating some members of the party may support the bill when the closely-divided Senate votes. Also, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is working on alternative legislation that her party could find more palatable and could keep some of the billâ€™s measures. Since Republicans swept Congress and the White House in Novemberâ€™s elections they have moved swiftly against regulation.  Using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers killed 14 Obama-era regulations in the span of three months. Trumpâ€™s efforts have yielded mixed results. His order to cut two existing regulations for every new one has stalled during a legal challenge. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency was jammed with thousands of pleas to maintain regulations when it asked for public comment on Trumpâ€™s order to look into repealing or rewriting current rules. The comment period closed Monday. ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0299,U.S. immigration arrests up nearly 40 percent under Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by nearly 40 percent in the first 100 days of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency, following executive orders that broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations, according to government data released on Wednesday. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas Homan said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year.  Of those arrested almost two-thirds had criminal convictions. But there was also a significant jump - of more than 150 percent - in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ICE: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non-criminal arrests in the same period in 2016. That increase is a result of recent guidance given by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to implement Trumpâ€™s executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on Jan. 25, just days after the Republican president took office.  â€œThose that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,â€?Homan said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency. He said ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime. â€œWhen a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,â€?Homan said. â€œIf we donâ€™t take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.â€? While President Barack Obama was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally.  Deportations under Trump have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under Obama, Homan said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system.   The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.  On Wednesday, state attorneys general from New York, California, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington D.C., issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents.  A section of one of the presidentâ€™s executive orders aimed to cut off federal funding to so-called â€œsanctuary cities,â€?was been blocked by a federal judge in California.

0300,State Department reminds staff on ethics after posts on Trump interests,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Departmentâ€™s legal office has reminded employees  not to promote private interests on social media after its online accounts publicized President Donald Trumpâ€™s private Florida resort and his daughter Ivanka Trumpâ€™s new book. An article on a State Department website in April about Mar-a-Lago and a retweet in May about the book were eventually withdrawn, but the new guidance issued on Tuesday said employees should â€œexercise caution before using a Department social media account to highlight non-official activities of U.S. government officials and their family.â€?The guidance was posted on an internal website and written by the Office of Ethics and Financial Disclosure of the State Departmentâ€™s Office of the Legal Adviser. A State Department official declined to comment on internal communications but said the legal adviserâ€™s office routinely provides guidance to employees on ethics matters. The guidance was directed to social media managers who oversee hundreds of official government accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms used by State Department agencies, consulates and embassies to communicate information and U.S. foreign policy. The guidance, which was seen by Reuters, never specifically mentions Trump or his family. But its content appeared to be at least in part in response to the postings on the resort and the book. â€œIf a government official has a commercial enterprise or has published a book, U.S. government resources should not be used to publicize those ventures,â€?the guidance said.  The posting on Trumpâ€™s resort was shared on the websites and social media accounts of several U.S. embassies. Ethics experts said the piece represented use of public office for private gain. The State Department said the article had been meant to inform the public about where Trump had been hosting world leaders. A Twitter account for the State Departmentâ€™s Office of Global Womenâ€™s Issues retweeted a post by Ivanka Trump in which she promoted her new book. Ivanka Trump serves in the White House as an adviser to her father. Trump maintains ownership of his global business empire, though he has handed control to his two oldest sons, an arrangement that ethics watchdogs say does not prevent conflicts of interest.

0302,U.S. governors work Senate as new power brokers in Obamacare repeal,"(Reuters) - A group of about a dozen Republican governors is pushing for its own set of national healthcare reforms, flexing its considerable muscle in the national debate over the future of Obamacare as the U.S. Senate begins writing its bill.  Led by Governor John Kasich of Ohio, the governors are using a nine-page proposal they crafted in February as the platform to shape what they think a critical portion of an Obamacare replacement law should look like, according to a half dozen people who helped write the plan.  Among the groupâ€™s recommendations for the Senate include maintaining the expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, while also limiting federal spending for certain populations, according to a copy of the proposal.  Members of the group, which include governors from Utah, Tennessee and Michigan, are also now looking to form a bipartisan coalition of states to propose reforms for the individual insurance market, according to one source, that they hope the Senate will also use. To see a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2qOZScv They have not yet met or decided on specific reforms about the individual insurance market, but the goal is to address issues such as how to make insurance more affordable and stabilize the markets. The House of Representatives narrowly passed its national healthcare bill earlier this month, called the American Health Care Act, which would slash federal Medicaid funding by more than $800 billion over the next decade.  It has prompted fierce criticism from both Republican and Democratic governors.  Kasich recently called the bill â€œinadequate,â€?and said it would leave millions of people without affordable coverage and â€œliving in the emergency rooms again.â€?  Pressure is building from their constituents.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has been tracking public opinion on health care issues for the past several years, has found that Republicans are more supportive than they were in 2013 of benefits including expanded Medicaid and insurance subsidies for low-income families and a government requirement that small businesses provide insurance for their employees. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States and gathered responses from 2,126 adults, including 887 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for Republicans. The governors group is looking to the Senate for massive changes as they begin writing their own bill. Several groups, from insurers and hospitals to medical groups and patient advocates, are trying to influence the Senate. But the governors carry extra weight because they will ultimately be responsible for implementing whatever healthcare overhaul is signed into law, and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly spoken about the need to have fewer federal regulations apply to Medicaid and commercial insurance. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican-led states, expanded Medicaid. One of the thorniest issues Republicans have grappled with is treating both expansion and non-expansion states equally. Governors from both types of states united to craft Medicaid proposals in the hope that their voice would carry added weight and provide a surer path for lawmakers.  The governors are also in the same boat politically as U.S. senators because both are elected statewide, rather than in smaller districts as House representatives are. So many governors and their senators have been better aligned on what healthcare reform should look like, several of the sources said. Several governors and their staff said they have been in regular contact with their senators, and will be pushing for the Senate to use the governorsâ€?set of reforms as a framework in writing its bill.  Senator Rob Portman of Ohio wrote in an op-ed Monday that he and other senators tasked with writing a healthcare bill have continued to engage with governors, â€œmany of who share my concerns about Medicaid but who also want more flexibility to ensure they can design health care programs that meet the individual needs of their states.â€? He added that the Senate will continue to work with governors on healthcare reform. â€œThey are definitely hearing our concerns and questions. They have been very attentive to our interests,â€?said Nathan Checketts, deputy director of the Utah Department of Health. The group of Republican governors has worked to have a unified voice to reconcile needs among a diverse set of states, including Arizona, Illinois, Wisconsin, Arkansas and Nevada. Its leaders, which also include Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan and Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona, deliberately chose some participants from states with influential Republican senators who would become key players in a federal healthcare overhaul.  A 13-member Senate panel has been tasked with writing a healthcare bill, and at least five of its senators are from states from the Republican governorsâ€?group, including Portman, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Mike Lee of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.  Other Republican senators with governors in the group - including Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona - are up for reelection in 2018.  As Senate Republicans take up the bill, one of the most complicated policy and political issues they must grapple with is Medicaid reform.  States that expanded Medicaid, such as Ohio and Michigan, have said a healthcare overhaul must protect those who gained coverage under Obamacare. Non-expansion states, meanwhile, have said they do not want to be penalized with less federal funding because they did not expand and therefore cover fewer people. The governorsâ€?proposal recommends maintaining Obamacareâ€™s Medicaid expansion and giving other states the opportunity to expand, but capping federal spending on certain populations through either block grants or per capita caps. It would provide states the option to phase in other groups, such as parents and children, to per capita caps or block grants, and it recommends reducing federal regulations on states and their Medicaid programs.

0304,Trump asked Comey to end investigation of Michael Flynn: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agencyâ€™s investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo written by Comey. The explosive new development on Tuesday followed a week of tumult at the White House after Trump fired Comey and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The Comey memo, first reported by the New York Times, caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. The White House quickly denied the report, saying in a statement it was â€œnot a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.â€?Comey wrote the memo after he met in the Oval Office with Trump, the day after the Republican president fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russiaâ€™s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. â€œI hope you can let this go,â€?Trump told Comey, according to a source familiar with the contents of the memo.  The New York Times said that during the Oval Office meeting, Trump condemned a series of government leaks to the news media and said the FBI director should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information. Coming the day after charges that Trump disclosed sensitive information to the Russians last week, the new disclosure further rattled members of Congress. â€œThe memo is powerful evidence of obstruction of justice and certainly merits immediate and prompt investigation by an independent special prosecutor,â€?said Democratic U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal. Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the memo. Republican U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of a House of Representatives oversight committee, said his committee â€œis going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.â€?In a letter to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Chaffetz set a deadline of May 24 for the FBI to produce â€œall memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President.â€?Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan backed Chaffetz. â€œWe need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo,â€?said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. Legal experts took a dim view of Trumpâ€™s comments, as quoted in the memo. â€œFor the president to tell the FBI to end a potential criminal investigation, thatâ€™s obstruction of justice,â€?said Erwin Chereminsky, a constitutional law professor and dean of University of California, Irvine School of Law. â€œThis is what caused President Nixon to resign from office.â€?But the experts said intent was a critical element of an obstruction of justice charge, and the presidentâ€™s words could be subject to interpretation and possibly put into the context of other actions, like Comeyâ€™s termination. The fact that the president apparently said he â€œhopedâ€?Comey would end the Flynn investigation rather than more directly ordering it â€œmakes for a weaker but still viable case,â€?said Christopher Slobogin, a criminal law professor at Vanderbilt University Law School. Flynnâ€™s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks earlier that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Kislyak before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Kislyak was with Lavrov at the White House when Trump disclosed the sensitive information. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment on the details of the memo. An emailed fundraising appeal by Trumpâ€™s political organization and the Republican National Committee sent out after reports of the Comey memo said Trump was being victimized by an â€œunelected bureaucracy.â€?â€œYou already knew the media was out to get us,â€?it said. â€œBut sadly itâ€™s not just the fake newsâ€?There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire â€˜America Firstâ€?movement.â€?The new development came as Republican and Democratic lawmakers pressured Trump to give a fuller explanation for why he revealed sensitive intelligence information to Lavrov.

President Donald Trump has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians during a White House meeting last week, saying he had an â€œabsolute rightâ€?to share â€œfacts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safetyâ€?  â€œDecisions about what President Trump discusses with anybody that he has in the White House is a matter for President Trump,â€?May told a news conference when asked whether Trumpâ€™s disclosure had made her reluctant to share intelligence with him. â€œWe continue to work with the United States and continue to share intelligence with the United States as we do with others around the world because we are all working together to deal with the threats that we face.â€?The question came during a press briefing ahead of Britainâ€™s June 8 election, which polls show May is on course to win, and in which national security is seen as one of her political strengths.

0308,Israeli intel experts alarmed by Trump leak but play down any damage,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence experts are gravely concerned that U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s sharing of classified information with Russia may have compromised an Israeli agent, but donâ€™t expect any long-term consequences for intelligence cooperation. Trump has confirmed via Twitter that during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the White House last week he shared information related to a potential airline plot by Islamic State, thought to involve a laptop bomb. The New York Times, citing a current and a former U.S. official, reported on Tuesday that the information Trump divulged came from an Israeli intelligence asset based in Islamic State-held territory in Syria.  Israeli officials have declined to confirm whether they were the source of the information Trump shared, but have been quick to say counter-terrorism coordination with the United States is strong. On Tuesday, Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss his visit to Israel next week, but the two did not discuss the intelligence leak during their 20-minute conversation, the prime ministerâ€™s office said.  â€œThe security relationship between Israel & our greatest ally the United States is deep, significant &  unprecedented in volume,â€?Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Twitter, remarks that were echoed by the intelligence minister.  Ron Dermer, Israelâ€™s ambassador to Washington, issued a similar statement, saying: â€œIsrael has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump.â€?Israeli intelligence experts said they could not confirm whether an Israeli asset was the source. But they said Israel had developed a deep network of human and signal intelligence across the region and it was plausible that it had managed to infiltrate Islamic State as part of that long-running effort. â€œIsraeli intelligence agencies have shown that they can have such human sources,â€?said Aviv Oreg, former head of the Al Qaeda and global jihad desk in the armyâ€™s military intelligence department, who now runs a counter-terrorism consultancy.  â€œIt would take a lot to put someone inside ISIS. If there is an agent, Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s the only one. If we have really lost a human source over there, itâ€™s a major loss and it will take years to regenerate another one,â€?he said. â€œIsrael will be furious about it,â€?he added, highlighting that it was likely to have implications for how Israel operates its human intelligence assets more broadly, and may make others unwilling to cooperate with it in the future. At the same time, he said Israel understood that Trump, as president and commander-in-chief, had the authority to divulge the information, even if in doing so he had shown that he â€œhas no experience in how to deal with intelligence.â€?Kobi Michael, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and the former deputy director of Israelâ€™s ministry of strategic affairs, described Trumpâ€™s leak as â€œvery concerningâ€?if there was a risk of having endangered an Israeli asset. While there were good reasons to assume the compromised source was an agent, he said it was also possible it was a well-placed piece of signal intelligence.  â€œWhen it comes to ISIS, they are very active in the social network world and on digital platforms. So who knows, all options are valid, even if as far as I understand the context, it looks like a human intelligence source.â€?Michael described Israel as having far better intelligence capabilities in the region than the United States, making it a critical partner for Washington. Yet both sides have an interest in continuing to cooperate fully on intelligence. â€œWhat happened is a problem, it shouldnâ€™t have happened. But mistakes do get made, not only by the Americans, but sometimes by the Israelis too,â€?said Michael.  â€œI assume that Trump had other considerations in mind and was perhaps not aware of the consequences of what he was saying. But this should not change the level of cooperation, which needs to be constantly broadened and deepened.â€?Amnon Sofrin, former head of Mossadâ€™s intelligence directorate, said the issue was unlikely to be touched on when Trump visits Israel on his first foreign trip next week. Handling the fallout from the leak would be dealt with through intelligence channels â€?between Mossad and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency â€?not diplomatic ones. â€œCooperation between our two organizations is so solid that I donâ€™t believe that a special event will cause any big damage, it may cause local damage, but not a disaster,â€?he said. â€œNone of us in Israelâ€™s intelligence community likes this event. But I think it can be put aside and allow (Trumpâ€™s) visit to be very fulfilling and I hope very successful.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0309,State of Washington law paves way for organic marijuana market,"(Reuters) - Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday signed a bill that paves the way for the state to create what is believed to be the first system in the United States to certify marijuana as organic. The sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Ann Rivers, said marijuana certified as organically grown is likely to be on sale in Washington in about a year and a half. Washington is among a handful of U.S. states where voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana. Washington was the second state to begin legal recreational pot sales, in mid-2014, after its voters in 2012 approved it. â€œThis is consumer-driven,â€?Rivers told Reuters by phone on Tuesday night. â€œAs we have moved forward in the legal marijuana market, weâ€™re hearing people say, â€˜We donâ€™t want any pesticides, fungicides, none of that stuff in our weed.â€™â€?The new law â€œcreates a voluntary program for the certification and regulation of organic marijuana products,â€?to be administered by the Washington agriculture department, according to a state analysis of the new law. Rivers said the â€œheavy liftingâ€?in certifying marijuana has been done by the system of doing the same for a multitude of food products on supermarkets shelves across America. That process just needs to be adapted for pot, she said. Rivers said that legal recreational marijuana is â€œthe gift that keeps on giving....this year, weâ€™ll make $768 millionâ€?in revenue for the state of Washington. This pays for drug education and drug addiction treatment as well as public education, she said. Organic pot was just one of a myriad of marijuana-related measures in the bill. Many state legislators wanted to vote for only one marijuana-related bill rather than have to go on the record favoring marijuana several times, Rivers said. The November 2012 measure to allow recreational marijuana in Washington passed 56 percent to 44 percent. While it is legal for adults to smoke marijuana in Washington, it is not legal to grow industrial hemp. The new law allows for the study of a method to allow hemp to be grown and used for industrial purposes. Last week, Vermontâ€™s legislature approved a bill to legalize recreational use of marijuana. Unless the measure is vetoed, Vermont would be the first state to legalize pot without a public vote. Voters have approved legal recreational marijuana use in Colorado,Â Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.   ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0310,UK punters back an early exit for Trump: bookmakers,"LONDON (Reuters) - British gamblers believe U.S. President Donald Trump is now more likely to leave office before the end of his first term than not, British bookmakers said on Wednesday, after a week of tumult at the White House. Betfair said that punters had bet more than 5,000 pounds ($6,470) on an early departure for Trump in the hours after it was reported he had asked his then-FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Concerns that businessman and former reality TV star Trumpâ€™s economic reforms could be slowed and he might even face the threat of impeachment has dented demand for the dollar. On UK betting markets, the odds on Trump failing to see out his four-year term dropped to 5/6 from evens on Betfair, implying a 55 percent chance that he will leave. Betfair was also offering odds of 12/5 percent that Trump would leave office this year, implying a 27 percent chance that he would depart. Betfair said that the odds for such an early departure had never been shorter. Fellow bookmaker Ladbrokes said its odds on the president leaving office via impeachment or resignation before the end of his first term had also shortened in the last week to 4/5 after a flurry of bets.  Spokeswoman Jessica Bridge added that Ladbrokes had taken close to 50,000 pounds on various wagers over Trumpâ€™s future, including whether he would be impeached and the year he might be replaced. â€œBarely a day goes by without a Trump scandal, but money talks, and punters are becoming increasingly convinced the president could be impeached sooner rather than later,â€?Bridge said. UK political betting markets have exploded in recent years, with millions wagered last year ahead of surprising results of Britainâ€™s referendum on European Union membership and Trumpâ€™s election which was the most bet-upon political event ever.  Bookmakers also saw their biggest market for a French election earlier this year, buoyed by growing enthusiasm for political betting, an unpredictable result and a ban on betting on politics in France.

0311,Factbox: Lawmakers want to see Comey memo on Trump meeting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers on Tuesday called for more information after reports that President Donald Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House said a memo written by Comey after he met with Trump in February was not an accurate portrayal of the conversation. Details of the memo were first reported by The New York Times and were confirmed by a Reuters source.  Last week, the Republican president fired Comey, who had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaignâ€™s possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome.  Flynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Media reports of the Comey memo prompted members of Congress to renew calls for an independent investigation into the Trump campaignâ€™s possible connections to Russia and for Comey to testify before Congress. Here are reactions from Capitol Hill: â€œ@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.â€?- Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Twitter. He later sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation a letter asking for all memos, notes and recordings between Comey and Trump by May 24. â€œWhat weâ€™re seeing ... is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time. And Iâ€™m still stunned that more of my Republican colleagues are not standing strong and speaking out.â€?- Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal to CNN â€œI have to say yes simply because obstruction of justice is such a serious offense. And I say it with sadness and reluctance.â€?- Independent Senator Angus King, asked on CNN if Congress was getting close to impeachment proceedings â€œWeâ€™re a long ways from a conviction - the fact that we simply have a headline in The New York Times.â€? - Republican Representative Trey Gowdy on Fox News â€œWe need to have all the facts and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo.â€?- AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, in a statement â€œI donâ€™t want to read a memo. I want to hear it from him (Comey).â€?- Republican Senator Lindsey Graham in an MSNBC interview â€œThis is an explosive allegation and it appears like a textbook case of criminal obstruction of justice. We need to hear testimony immediately from Director Comey - in public. ... We also obviously need to get Director Comeyâ€™s memos immediately, as well as all associated records, including any audio tapes, and notes, if they exist.â€?- Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings in a statement â€œIf true, this is yet another disturbing allegation that the president may have engaged in some interference or obstruction of the investigation. I think we know enough now. Thereâ€™s been enough alleged publicly to want to bring the director back to testify, ideally in open session, either before our committee or the Judiciary Committee.â€?- Democratic Representative Adam Schiff to reporters â€œCountry must have answers. It is clear former FBI Director Comey should testify before Congress.â€? - Republican Representative Frank LoBiondo on Twitter  â€œIf these reports are true, the presidentâ€™s brazen attempt to shut down the FBIâ€™s investigation of Michael Flynn is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy. At best, President Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power. At worst, he has obstructed justice.â€?- Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi in a statement  â€œIâ€™m shocked and surprised by this development and would like to discuss it with Chairman Grassley and look forward to doing so. The Judiciary Committee is the appropriate place to hold a hearing and get to the bottom of exactly what was said and by whom.â€?- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein in a statement â€œThe stories of the last week raise serious questions about whether the president respects the independence of the FBI and law enforcement authorities. It is vital that Congress obtain these memos and hear public testimony from former Director Comey. ... The American people deserve answers about President Trumpâ€™s conduct.â€? - Democratic Senator Bob Casey in a statement ",politicsNews,2017/5/17,1
0312,Mexico expects NAFTA talks by late August: economy minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday he expects U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to tell Congress early next week of plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that would produce talks by late August. Guajardo said he would have more information after meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Vietnam on Thursday as part of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. During the 2016 U.S. election campaign, Trump vowed to scrap the 1994 deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico if he cannot adjust it to benefit U.S. interests. â€œProbably the notification will be sent to Congress by the U.S. executive at some time early next week,â€?Guajardo told Mexican media on Tuesday a day after meetings in Washington with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other U.S. officials. In Washington, Ross declined to predict the exact timing of the notification, saying that there were more consultations with Congress needed first. In a meeting on Tuesday, U.S. senators said Ross and new U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed their preference to keep the current trilateral format in the NAFTA talks.   Guajardo also said that a dispute over sugar with the United States could be resolved within two weeks, before a June 5 deadline to break the impasse.  The U.S. sugar industry pressed the U.S. Commerce Department late last year to withdraw from a 2014 agreement that sets prices and quotas for U.S. imports of Mexican sugar unless the deal could be renegotiated. The U.S. sugar lobby wants Mexico to export less refined sugar and has become emboldened since Trump took office. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said Ross and Guajardo  discussed possible solutions and that they continue to work toward a negotiated settlement. Any deal, however, would need agreement from the U.S. sugar producers who brought an anti-dumping case against Mexican competitors. On Monday, Mexicoâ€™s sugar chamber said no deal had been reached in talks on Monday to resolve the dispute. ",politicsNews,2017/5/16,1
0313,Trump trade officials prefer tri-lateral NAFTA deal: U.S. senators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s top trade officials hope to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral deal in negotiations with Canada and Mexico to revamp the 23-year-old pact, senators said on Tuesday. Several members of the Senate Finance Committee said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and new U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told them in a closed door meeting that they would prefer the current three-nation format but left open the possibility of parallel bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. â€œTheir preference is trilateral,â€?Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow told reporters after the meeting. Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said from the meeting it sounded to him as if a trilateral deal was more likely â€œunless thereâ€™s problemsâ€?with that approach. â€œIf trilaterally you arenâ€™t getting anyplace, I suppose then you do it bilaterally,â€?Grassley said. Ross, who has floated the idea of doing two bilateral trade deals with Canada and Mexico, declined to confirm the administrationâ€™s preference for a trilateral approach. â€œRight now it is a trilateral deal and we shall see what comes in the future but the important thing is to get to the substance,â€?Ross told reporters after leaving the meeting, adding that talks would be â€œlong and complicated.â€?The meeting was one of several on Capitol Hill this week involving Lighthizer, who was sworn in as U.S. trade representative on Monday, that are required for the Trump administration to trigger the start of the NAFTA negotiating process with a 90-day consultation period. Farm state senators said they also warned Ross and Lighthizer not to take actions that would damage agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico.  â€œWe made it pretty clear thatâ€™s a priority, that we donâ€™t want to see ag hurt,â€?said Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican. â€œNAFTA by and large has been good for agriculture, and weâ€™re seeing some disruptions in the ag marketplace today because of uncertainty about where this is headed.â€?Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Finance Committeeâ€™s top Democrat, said Ross and Lighthizer assured him they would push to drop NAFTAâ€™s dispute-resolution mechanism. Trump has complained that the mechanism is biased against the United States. ",politicsNews,2017/5/16,1
0314,Trump asked Comey to shut down Flynn probe: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, an associate of Comey, who has seen the memo, said on Tuesday. The associate told Reuters that the details of the document as first reported by the New York Times were accurate.  â€œI hope you can let this go,â€?Trump told Comey, according to  the language of the memo, which the source confirmed. The White House denied the report in a statement to reporters, saying it was â€œnot a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.â€?The memo was written by Comey immediately after his meeting in the White House Oval Office with Trump one day after Flynn resigned over his contacts with Russians.  Flynnâ€™s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks earlier that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak before Trump took power on Jan. 20. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment on the details of the memo. ",politicsNews,2017/5/16,1
0315,"Following advice, potential FBI chiefs steer clear of job under Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s search for a new FBI director hit roadblocks on Tuesday when two high-profile potential candidates, a moderate judge and a conservative senator, signaled they did not want the job. Advisers to Judge Merrick Garland and U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas told Reuters they discouraged them from leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cautioning that they would be leaving important, secure jobs for one fraught with politics and controversy.  The advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the new FBI director would have little job security and heightened scrutiny by political observers following President Donald Trumpâ€™s abrupt firing of James Comey on May 9.  Garland and Cornyn distancing themselves from the selection process just three days before Trump has said he may make a decision, points to the difficulties the White House has in filling the FBI post amid turmoil in the administration.     Trumpâ€™s firing of Comey, the man in charge of an investigation into possible collusion between 2016 election campaign associates and the Russian government, outraged many lawmakers, including some Republicans. Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, â€œloves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary,â€?said one source familiar with the judgeâ€™s thinking. Cornyn said in a statement that he had informed the White House that â€œthe best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate.â€?White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that an announcement on FBI director was still possible before  Trump leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. He said the U.S. Department of Justice was still interviewing candidates. Several Republican senators had promoted Garland even though they had refused to give him a hearing when Republican Trumpâ€™s predecessor President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland last year for a then-vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Republicansâ€?reasoning appeared to be that Garland would be accepted by Democrats and help restore faith in the FBI as a nonpartisan agency. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred to Garland, a former federal prosecutor, as â€œan apolitical professional.â€?A second Garland acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Garland sought advice from those who told him he would be leaving his life-long position on the federal bench to take a job that could be terminated by Trump overnight. A Republican Senate aide said Cornynâ€™s staff also worried that the third-term Texas Senator could cut his- and their own- careers short by going to the FBI.  An adviser to another candidate on the White House short-list, former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, 75, said Kelly is also being persuaded to step out of the running.  Kelly has not said that he would not consider the job, but so far he has not been interviewed. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor whose name had been floated, said on Monday he was not interested in the director position.  The difficulty in filling key administration jobs is not just limited to the FBI director post. Trumpâ€™s habits of contradicting his top aides, demanding personal loyalty and punishing officials who contradict him in public has discouraged a number of experienced people from pursuing jobs, said three people who declined to discuss possible positions with administration officials. â€œItâ€™s becoming increasingly difficult to attract good people to work in this administration,â€?said one senior official. â€œIn other cases, veteran people with expertise are leaving or seeking posts overseas and away from this White House.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/16,1
0316,"Top U.S. diplomat for Middle East to retire, U.S. officials say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East has told colleagues that he has decided to retire, three U.S. officials said on Tuesday, the latest senior U.S. diplomat to leave the Trump administration. Stuart Jones, acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, has extensive experience in the Middle East after serving as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Jordan and as deputy chief of mission in Cairo. Jones, 57, told colleagues the decision was his own and that he had not been pushed out or asked to leave the department. â€œThis is his own decision ... Thereâ€™s not been a falling out,â€?said a U.S. official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. â€œThereâ€™s no story here, except another senior government official with real competence is leaving.â€?A State Department spokesman confirmed Jonesâ€?planned retirement, saying he was leaving for personal reasons to pursue a new career. Jonesâ€?case is different from those of two career foreign service officers - former undersecretaries of state Patrick Kennedy, the departmentâ€™s top management official, and Thomas Countryman, its top arms control officer - who had risen to politically appointed jobs and were asked to leave in January. The decision to accept their resignations was entirely within President Donald Trumpâ€™s rights and there is usually turnover in such politically appointed jobs. But it constituted an abrupt departure for the two. Former State Department counselor Kristie Kenney also left in February, further shrinking the senior ranks of the agency. Jones was elevated to acting assistant secretary of state responsible for the Near East and had neither been offered the job on a permanent basis nor told that he would not get it, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This official said Jones was not asked to leave and wanted to make his plans known so there would not be speculation that he had been forced out. Career diplomats with deep regional experience are typically chosen to run the State Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Officials who fit that profile include Robert â€œSteveâ€?Beecroft, U.S. ambassador to Egypt; David Hale, U.S. ambassador to Pakistan; and Douglas Silliman, U.S. ambassador to Iraq.

0318,Democrats in U.S. Senate try to slow Republican deregulation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are striking back at the U.S. Congress and White House over their push to cut regulations, as Republicans ratchet up attacks on rules they say hurt business and give bureaucrats too much power. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, on Tuesday introduced legislation to kill the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a law Republicans used over the span of three months this year to repeal 14 regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama, also a Democrat. Booker, one of his partyâ€™s liberal stars, says that rate shows the CRA is prone to abuse, and the law helps special interests sabotage thoroughly vetted rules they do not like. Bookerâ€™s bill, co-sponsored by fellow Democrat Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, would give future administrations the ability to resurrect the 14 annulled regulations on broadband, contraception, guns, the environment, education and other areas.  The CRA bans agencies from issuing new versions of repealed rules in the future. Bookerâ€™s bill would also lift that ban. Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline and Michigan Representative John Conyers, both Democrats, introduced a companion bill in the House on Tuesday. Senator Patty Murray, the senior Democrat of the committee overseeing labor and pensions, also is attempting to work around the prohibition through bills to make two of the eliminated regulations, on retirement savings and workplace safety, the law of the land. She has introduced a bill to help states and cities provide retirement accounts to private-sector workers and has co-sponsored another on employersâ€?records of injuries and deaths.  If any of the Democratsâ€?bills survive the Senate, they would likely die in the House, where Republicans hold an ample majority. After sweeping Congress and the White House in Novemberâ€™s elections, Republicans established a beachhead in their battle against regulation through the CRA.  They are now in the next phase: limiting new rule-makings. Later this week a Senate committee will put finishing touches on the Regulatory Accountability Act and send it to the full chamber. Supporters say the bill, already passed in the House, makes regulators more answerable to lawmakers and more responsible for analyzing rulesâ€?costs. Critics say it establishes so many requirements that it will paralyze regulation in important areas such as education. Republicans are also considering keeping the CRA in play.  Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has asked congressional auditors to determine if the law can be applied to agenciesâ€?guidance that effectively resembles regulation. Others are weighing killing two forthcoming rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, an Obama holdover. ",politicsNews,2017/5/16,1

Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has told people around him he â€œloves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary,â€?said one of the sources familiar with the judgeâ€™s thinking. The two sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he has mentioned Garland to Republican President Donald Trump as a possible successor James Comey, who Trump fired last week as FBI chief. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, McConnell referred to Garland, a former federal prosecutor, as â€œan apolitical professionalâ€?to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Under McConnellâ€™s leadership, the Senate last year refused to consider centrist Garland for a lifetime job as a Supreme Court justice after Democratic President Barack Obama nominated him in March 2016. In doing so, McConnell was able to allow Trump, who took office in January, to nominate Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat, restoring the Supreme Courtâ€™s conservative majority. Garland, 64, has been praised by both Democrats and Republicans in his two decades on the appeals court. His appointment there is a lifetime one, and if he took on a 10-year term at the FBI it would open up another top judicial seat for Trump to fill.  Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Comeyâ€™s replacement would need to be someone with a deep background in law enforcement and no history of political involvement, McConnell said. Garland â€œis an example of that,â€?McConnell added. â€œIt would serve the country well and lead to, I think, a more bipartisan approach.â€?Democrats have threatened to hold up a vote on a new FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate the potential ties between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. At least 11 people have been under consideration for the  FBI top job. As a senior Justice Department official under Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, Garland oversaw the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, the man who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people.

0324,U.S. allies seen cooperating despite alleged Trump secrets leak,"SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s alleged disclosure of highly classified information to Russiaâ€™s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating, officials said on Tuesday. Some experts added, however, that the reports could undermine trust between partners.  â€œIf this really happened, itâ€™s an unfortunate episode,â€? said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now with the European Leadership Network think-tank in London.Â â€œBut theyâ€™ll suck it up. Why? Because other countries need U.S. intelligence cooperation more than the other way round.â€? In a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Trump disclosed intelligence about a planned Islamic State operation, which was supplied by a U.S. ally, two officials with knowledge of the situation said. The name of the ally or intelligence-sharing operation was not disclosed. [nL2N1IH1O9] The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect and Trump said he had an â€œabsolute rightâ€?to share facts to get Moscow to step up its fight against Islamic State. Interfax news agency quoted the Russian foreign ministry saying the reports were â€œfakeâ€? [nR4N1I601L] Two of Washingtonâ€™s allies in the intelligence sharing network known as â€œFive Eyesâ€?- which groups the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - played down the impact on their relationship with Washington. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told a radio station in Adelaide he would maintain â€œmy normal circumspection and discretionâ€?on classified matters, adding the alliance with the United States â€œis the bedrock of our national securityâ€? Trump and Turnbull met last week aboard a decommissioned aircraft carrier in New York City after beginning their relations with a testy phone call in February. [nL1N1I701T] New Zealand Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee noted the story had been denied. â€œThe media reports have been rejected by senior U.S. officials who were in the meeting,â€?he said in an email via his spokeswoman. â€œIf there is ever to be a resolution of the dreadful situation in Syria, it will require concerted efforts from both the U.S. and Russia.â€?A Japanese government official said it was simply not possible to stop cooperating with Washington on intelligence matters.â€If the report is true and Mr. Trump is an untrustworthy person, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that we donâ€™t share information with the U.S. anymore,â€?said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the two U.S. officials said. National security analysts said relations could be damaged. â€œEffectively, Trumpâ€™s actions have thrown the worldâ€™s most important intel sharing relationship into doubt at best, serious jeopardy at worst,â€?Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst for the Canadian government, said on Twitter, referring to the â€œFive Eyesâ€?arrangement. James Curran, professor of foreign policy at the University of Sydney, said the intelligence relationships were too important and productive to be damaged by Trumpâ€™s alleged disclosures to the Russians. â€œNo real practical impact, but I do think it will raise more eyebrows about this presidentâ€™s style and his cavalier attitude to this type of thing, said Curran. Over the long term, however, such behavior â€œcan potentially have very serious consequences for Americaâ€™s intelligence relationships across the worldâ€? Curran said. Rhys Ball, who formerly worked for New Zealandâ€™s intelligence service and is now a Massey University security and defense analyst, said he thought it would be â€œbusiness as usualâ€?for the â€œFive Eyesâ€?community. â€œClearly someone has gulped at what was discussed or exchanged. But this might be the new norm when it comes to the United states and its attitude and foreign policy approach to the likes of the Russians,â€?Ball said. Even before Trumpâ€™s meeting with the Russians, Washingtonâ€™s intelligence partners abroad have noted a barrage of reports around Trump, the Russians and spies. They include the investigations into his election campaignâ€™s ties to Moscow, probes into Russian interference in the election, the presidentâ€™s own expressions of disdain for the U.S. intelligence community and his claim that former President Barack Obama spied on him, citing a media report. â€œFirst the firing of the FBI chief and now this,â€?said one NATO diplomat referring to Trumpâ€™s decision to dismiss FBI Director James Comey. â€œHow do we know the U.S. defense secretary wonâ€™t be fired next week or that intelligence finds its way into the wrong hands?â€? But Ball said intelligence co-operation was too important to be constrained. â€œFive Eyes is far too significant for anyone to wash their hands of it and Five Eyes has weathered a few storms over the years,â€?Ball said.

He said he had focused on U.S. schools because they hosted most of the worldâ€™s top 20 economics programs. â€œBefore the travel ban, I never really considered other alternatives.â€? By late March, U.S. courts had halted two versions of Trumpâ€™s travel ban, yet Forouzandeh signed for University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management and turned down the University of Minnesotaâ€™s prestigious PhD program. His countryman, Mahdi Ebrahimi Kahou, 30, was well into his first year of the Minnesota program when he decided to transfer to the University of British Columbia because of Trumpâ€™s executive orders that banned travel from seven and later six Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. â€œI lost my motivation to work completely,â€?he said.  A Reuters survey of 19 Canadian universities showed a spike in international applications, most notably from Iran and India. Five top Canadian economics and business PhD programs are getting at least half of their new Iranian students this fall because of the ban, based on interviews with universities and students. Most of those, like Forouzandeh and Ebrahimi Kahou, are opting out of U.S. programs in a field where the United States both dominates and relies on foreign talent. While those programs represent only one field and a fraction of the U.S. student population, they offer early evidence of the direct impact of Trump administration policies. Academics fear they may also be a sign of things to come if the chilling effect of Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?agenda spreads beyond any specific field of study or nationality. â€œThis strikes at the heart of what has made U.S. higher education the envy of the world,â€?said Mary Sue Coleman, chair of the Association of American Universities.    â€œItâ€™s this notion that the U.S. is no longer a welcoming place for the best and the brightest.â€?  Iranians are by far the biggest group among students directly affected by the bans and form a small but notable part of the talent pool in areas such as engineering and economics, where U.S. academic institutions excel. Iranians ranked sixth last year among international students enrolled in U.S. graduate programs, according to the Institute of International Education.  A survey conducted jointly by five U.S. higher education associations in February showed 38 percent of U.S. colleges reporting a drop in foreign applications, with those from the Middle East down the most, while 27 percent saw no change - a significant cool-down after nearly a decade of steady growth. In 2015, at least 35 percent of graduate students at U.S. universities granting graduate degrees in science, engineering and health were foreigners, according to the National Science Foundation.  (For a graphic on U.S. universities, global brains, click tmsnrt.rs/2qLARio ) This year, about 60 percent of graduating PhDs from the top 10 U.S. economics departments come from other countries, a Reuters analysis shows. â€œYouâ€™ve got an issued order thatâ€™s been temporarily blocked that applies to six countries. But the destabilization of the whole situation for international students and faculty could not be overstated,â€?said Rice University President David Leebron. He said that for foreign students everything from getting a visa on time to employment opportunities had been thrown into question. According to Riceâ€™s dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies, this yearâ€™s PhD programs will have slightly fewer Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern students than expected. More Iranian students declined offers of admission than usual, with several saying that they decided to study in another country because of concerns about getting a U.S. visa.  There is no evidence of a mass exodus of foreigners - indeed, Rice will have more students than expected from Europe and Latin America, offsetting declines elsewhere - but academics cite dozens of examples where Trumpâ€™s policies had an impact. At Arizona State University, for example, Iranians would typically make up a fourth of the economics PhD program, but there will be none in the incoming class this fall. Of those already enrolled, two are moving to Canada. One student who visited his family in Iran over the Christmas break still has not been able to return, leaving the university scrambling to cover the classes he was supposed to teach.   â€œThe effects of this are big,â€?said Gustavo Ventura, ASUâ€™s economics department chair. â€œThese people, not just the ones that come to us - anyone who comes to a PhD program abroad - are the cream of their student population.â€?The University of Illinois now has 10 Iranians in its PhD program, and while itâ€™s not certain why, none of the Iranians whom it offered admission are among the 22 students from 11 countries entering in the fall.  At Indiana Universityâ€™s economics program, three Iranians withdrew their applications almost immediately after the travel ban, said Todd Walker, director of the departmentâ€™s graduate studies. â€œWe also had many more international applicants turn us down this year relative to the last three years,â€?he said. â€œI cannot say definitively how much of this is attributable to the travel ban, but I suspect it played a role.â€?In British Columbia, the Simon Fraser University has admitted 20 percent more international students for the fall term, according to Associate Dean Jeff Derksen. He said queries he had received and an online survey suggested more graduate students were considering alternatives to U.S. programs. â€œThis indicates that the international map of academic knowledge production has changed.â€?The prestige of the U.S. programs remains a big draw, but those committed to a U.S. career are more aware of risks.  For example, SoheilÂ Ghili, who is getting a PhD in economics from Northwestern Universityâ€™s Kellogg School of Management this month and will start as a post-doctoral fellow at Yale this summer, is hedging his bets. â€œLet me put it this way: I will be more careful to not miss networking opportunities with people from Toronto and London.â€?

0329,Trump revealed intelligence secrets to Russians in Oval Office: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russiaâ€™s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation, two U.S. officials said on Monday, plunging the White House into another controversy just months into Trumpâ€™s short tenure in office. The intelligence, shared at a meeting last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, was supplied by a U.S. ally in the fight against the militant group, both officials with knowledge of the situation said. The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect. â€œThe story that came out tonight as reported is false,â€?H.R. McMaster, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, told reporters at the White House, adding that the leaders reviewed a range of common threats including to civil aviation. â€œAt no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known...I was in the room. It didnâ€™t happen,â€?he said. Russiaâ€™s foreign ministry said reports that Trump had revealed highly classified information were â€œfakeâ€? according to the Interfax news agency. The White House also released a statement from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the Oval Office meeting focused on counterterrorism, and from Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell, who called the Washington Post story false. Still, the news triggered concern in Congress.  The Senateâ€™s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, called Trumpâ€™s conduct â€œdangerousâ€?and â€œrecklessâ€?  Bob Corker, the Republican head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the allegations â€œvery, very troublingâ€?if true.  â€œObviously, theyâ€™re in a downward spiral right now and theyâ€™ve got to come to grips with all thatâ€™s happening,â€?he said of the White House.     The latest controversy came as Trumpâ€™s administration reels  from the fallout over his abrupt dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey and amid congressional calls for an independent investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. One of the officials said the intelligence discussed by Trump in his meeting with Lavrov was classified â€œTop Secretâ€?and held in a secure â€œcompartmentâ€?to which only a handful of intelligence officials have access. After Trumpâ€™s disclosure of the information, which one of the officials described as spontaneous, officials immediately called the CIA and the National Security Agency, both of which have agreements with a number of allied intelligence services around the world, and informed them what had happened. While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the U.S. officials said. Since taking office in January, Trump has careened from controversy to controversy, complaining on the first day about news coverage of his inauguration crowds; charging his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, with wiretapping; and just last week firing the FBI director who was overseeing an investigation into potential ties between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and the Russian government. Trump, a Republican who has called allegations of links between his campaign team and Russia a â€œtotal scam,â€?sharply criticized his 2016 election rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, for her handling of classified information as secretary of state, when she used a private email server.  The FBI concluded that no criminal charges against Clinton were warranted, but Comey said she and her colleagues had been â€œcarelessâ€?with classified information.     In his conversations with the Russian officials, Trump appeared to be boasting about his knowledge of the looming threats, telling them he was briefed on â€œgreat intel every day,â€?an official with knowledge of the exchange said, according to the Post. Some U.S. officials have told Reuters they have been concerned about disclosing highly classified intelligence to Trump. One official, who requested anonymity to discuss dealing with the president, said last month: â€œHe has no filter; itâ€™s in one ear and out the mouth.â€?One of the officials with knowledge of Trumpâ€™s meeting with the Russian called the timing of the disclosure â€œparticularly unfortunate,â€?as the President prepares for a White House meeting on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, an ally in the fight against Islamic State. Trumpâ€™s first foreign trip also begins later this week and includes a stop in Saudi Arabia, another Islamic State foe, and a May 25 NATO meeting in Brussels attended by other important U.S. allies. He also has stops planned in Israel and the Vatican. The presidentâ€™s trip and latest uproar over his meeting with Russian officials come amid rumors that he might shake-up his  senior staff in a bid to refocus his administration.

0330,"In travel ban case, U.S. judges focus on discrimination, Trump's powers","SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. appeals court judges on Monday questioned the lawyer defending President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary travel ban about whether it discriminates against Muslims and pressed challengers to explain why the court should not defer to Trumpâ€™s presidential powers to set the policy. The three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel was the second court in a week to review Trumpâ€™s directive banning people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries. Opponents - including the state of Hawaii and civil rights groups - say that both Trumpâ€™s first ban and later revised ban discriminate against Muslims. The government argues that the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks. In addressing the Justice Department at the hearing in Seattle, 9th Circuit Judge Richard Paez pointed out that many of Trumpâ€™s statements about Muslims came â€œduring the midst of a highly contentious (election) campaign.â€?He asked if that should be taken into account when deciding how much weight they should be given in reviewing the travel banâ€™s constitutionality. Neal Katyal, an attorney for Hawaii which is opposing the ban, said the evidence goes beyond Trumpâ€™s campaign statements. â€œThe government has not engaged in mass, dragnet exclusions in the past 50 years,â€?Katyal said. â€œThis is something new and unusual in which youâ€™re saying this whole class of people, some of whom are dangerous, we can ban them all.â€?The Justice Department argues Trump issued his order solely to protect national security. Outside the Seattle courtroom a group of protesters gathered carrying signs with slogans including, â€œThe ban is still racistâ€?and â€œNo ban, no wall.â€? Paez asked if an executive order detaining Japanese-Americans during the World War Two would pass muster under the governmentâ€™s current logic.  Acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, said that the order from the 1940s, which is now viewed as a low point in U.S. civil rights history, would not be constitutional.  If Trumpâ€™s executive order was the same as the one involving Japanese-Americans, Wall said: â€œI wouldnâ€™t be standing here, and the U.S. would not be defending it.â€?Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked challengers to Trumpâ€™s ban about the wide latitude held by U.S. presidents to decide who can enter the country. â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t we be deferential to what the president says?â€?Hawkins said. â€œThat is the million dollar question,â€?said Katyal. A reasonable person would see Trumpâ€™s statements as evidence of discriminatory intent, Katyal said.   In Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing that the executive order is â€œfully lawful and will be upheld. We believe that.â€?  The panel, made up entirely of judges appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, reviewed a Hawaii judgeâ€™s ruling that blocked parts of the Republican presidentâ€™s revised travel order.  The March order was Trumpâ€™s second effort to craft travel restrictions. The first, issued on Jan. 27, led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts. The second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban, but it was also suspended by judges before it could take effect on March 16.  U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii blocked 90-day entry restrictions on people from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as part of the order that suspended entry of refugee applicants for 120 days. As part of that ruling, Watson cited Trumpâ€™s campaign statements on Muslims as evidence that his executive order was discriminatory. The 9th Circuit previously blocked Trumpâ€™s first executive order.  Last week the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia reviewed a Maryland judgeâ€™s ruling that blocked the 90-day entry restrictions. That court is largely made up of Democrats, and the judgesâ€?questioning appeared to break along partisan lines. A ruling has not yet been released. Trumpâ€™s attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office. The fate of the ban is one indication of whether the Republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security. The U.S. Supreme Court is likely to be the ultimate decider, but the high court is not expected to take up the issue for several months. ",politicsNews,2017/5/15,1

0334,More Americans want 'independent' investigation of Trump: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of Americans, including a growing number of Republicans, want to see an â€œindependent investigationâ€?sort out any connections between Russia and President Donald Trump during the 2016 election campaign, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday.  The May 10-14 poll, which was conducted after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, suggests the public is increasingly uneasy with allegations of meddling by the Russians in the U.S. election. Trumpâ€™s dismissal of Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe into ties between the White House and Russia, intensified calls by Democrats for an independent probe.  According to the poll, 59 percent of adults, including 41 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of Democrats, agreed that â€œCongress should launch an independent investigation into communications between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.â€? That compares with 54 percent of all adults, including 30 percent of Republicans and 81 percent of Democrats, who felt that way when the poll last asked the question in February.Â   â€œI really donâ€™t know what to believe anymore,â€?said John Kremer, 74, a Trump supporter from Birmingham, Alabama, who wants an independent investigation. Kremer does not think Trump had any illegal contact with the Russians, but he does not like the way the president is handling he issue.  â€œIf Comey hadnâ€™t been fired, I would have been comfortable with the results of their investigation,â€?Kremer said. â€œMy concern now is whether he (Trump) is trying to minimize the investigation.â€? The Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that public confidence in the executive branch and in Congress has eroded since the Nov. 8 election. Thirty-six percent of Americans said they had â€œhardly any confidence at allâ€?in the executive branch and 43 percent said they felt that way about Congress. That is up from 30 percent and 37 percent, respectively, who answered that way in a November poll.  When asked who should replace Comey, 48 percent wanted an FBI outsider with â€œcredibleâ€?experience in law or law enforcement. Thirty-seven percent said they wanted â€œsomeone from within the FBIâ€?while 5 percent wanted an FBI outsider who is â€œclose to the Trump administration.â€? The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. It included responses from 1,541 adults, including 515 Republicans and 686 Democrats.

Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and deputy USTR during the Reagan administration, was sworn into office by Vice President Mike Pence, capping months of delays and filling the last open seat in President Donald Trumpâ€™s cabinet. Lighthizer will be one of three key leaders on trade policy, working alongside Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade and industrial policy adviser Peter Navarro. All three have vowed to help shrink chronic U.S. trade deficits through stronger enforcement of U.S. trade laws and to negotiate deals that boost U.S. exports without leading to jobs and factories migrating overseas.   â€œWhen my grandchildren, who are here today, talk to their grandchildren, they will say that President Trump permanently reversed the dangerous trajectory of American trade, put America first and made our farmers, ranchers and workers richer and the country safer,â€?Lighthizer said. â€œI hope I can make some small contribution to that accomplishment.â€?Lighthizer, 69, will be the principal U.S. negotiator in talks expected to start later this year to revamp the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. On Tuesday, he will start two days of meetings with members of key trade-related panels in Congress, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee said. The meetings are required before USTR can formally launch the formal renegotiating process with a 90-day consultation period. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also said Lighthizer will attend the May 20-21 meeting of trade ministers from the 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Hanoi, Vietnam. At that meeting, Lighthizer will face many counterparts who were signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-country free trade agreement from which Trump withdrew in January. Some countries, including Japan, have been exploring options to revive TPP without the United States. China, the largest U.S. trading partner, also is a member of APEC, allowing Lighthizer an opportunity to meet his Chinese counterparts as the Trump administration seeks to build on agreements to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with China.

0341,Trump administration vastly expands global anti-abortion policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday it was vastly expanding the scope of a policy blocking U.S. assistance to foreign groups that perform or provide information about abortions, a move critics say will hinder womenâ€™s access to critical care. The new policy means that $8.8 billion in U.S. assistance to an array of programs fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria and maternal and child health will be subject to the so-called Mexico City policy. The policy, introduced in 1984, holds that no U.S. government funding for family planning services can be given to foreign clinics or groups that offer abortion services or discuss abortion, even if the funds for those activities come from non-U.S. government sources. The policy previously applied to a much narrower stream of about $600 million in U.S. government funds. Since it was unveiled, the Mexico City rule has been routinely rescinded under Democratic administrations and reinstated under Republican ones, and is used by presidents to signal where they stand on abortion rights. Critics of the policy call it the â€œglobal gag rule,â€?and say it hurts vulnerable women worldwide who depend on aid groups for their healthcare. Even when the Mexico City policy is not in place, federal law prevents the use of U.S. funding for abortions abroad.  President Donald Trump, a Republican, reinstated the policy in January, just days after taking office, but he went further and directed government agencies to figure out a plan to apply the policy â€œto global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.â€?U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has approved a plan to expand the policyâ€™s provisions to funding for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria and other health programs, the State Department said on Monday. That includes about $6 billion in funding for the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the worldâ€™s largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine. PEPFAR, launched in 2003 during Republican President George W. Bushâ€™s administration, has been credited with saving millions of lives and enjoys bipartisan support.  Other programs affected by the expanded policy, called â€œProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance,â€?include the Presidentâ€™s Malaria Initiative, which received about $621 million in funding in 2016, according to its website. The State Department said in a statement: â€œProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance does not reduce the amount of global health assistance the U.S. Government makes available, and funding previously obligated will not be affected as a result of this policy.â€?U.S. officials said the malaria and HIV/AIDS programs would be resilient even if the United States had to deny funding to existing healthcare providers. â€œWe have a diversity of partners who are providing services and that would be available to continue those services,â€?a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The new policy applies to funds provided to foreign non-governmental organizations, but not to aid provided to governments or multilateral organizations, the State Department said. The expanded policy also does not apply to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief or to U.N. funds and programs. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the expanded policy would have â€œsevere consequences for millions of vulnerable women and children.â€?Anti-abortion groups praised the decision, saying it merely represented a realignment of funding.

The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement he hoped senators would use the briefing at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to seek the â€œfull truthâ€?about Comeyâ€™s dismissal, press Rosenstein â€œto make wayâ€?for a special prosecutor and ensure the administration preserves and makes public any audio recordings of his conversations with Comey. Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly firing Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Russia denies it sought to interfere in the election. Trump has dismissed such talk as little more than sour grapes by Democrats who cannot accept his upset victory on Nov. 8. Democrats have been calling for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate, saying getting to the bottom of foreign interference in the U.S. election is too important to leave to potentially partisan committees in Congress. Comeyâ€™s firing last week added to the worries, and even some of Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans have expressed concern about the timing of his dismissal. The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said she has asked Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan to request a similar briefing for the House. There was no immediate word from Ryanâ€™s office. However, administration officials typically do not conduct such briefings for only one of the two chambers. ",politicsNews,2017/5/15,1
0344,"Working the farm, while Trump talks tough on immigration","KING CITY, Calif. (Reuters) - On an overcast spring morning, about 40 Mexican men turned out in the pre-dawn hours to board a bus for Californiaâ€™s Salinas Valley where they would harvest 16 acres (6.47 hectares) of lettuce over the next three days.  Hector Manuel Morales, 20, came north from Mexico to work the fields with his three cousins. He said his family worried about his journey, spooked by President Donald Trumpâ€™s talk of a crackdown on illegal immigrants. But he does not anticipate problems.  While about half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally, Morales and the other men have H-2A visas, which allow them to work temporarily as seasonal agricultural laborers on American farms.  â€œWe are not violating any law here in the U.S.,â€?he said. â€œWe come to work.â€? His co-worker Rafael Gonzalez Arredondo, 23, said listening to Trumpâ€™s statements about Mexico was â€œdifficult, but we are going to show him that Mexicans are hard working people, that we are not what he says.â€?The men came to the country through a labor brokerage company, Fresh Harvest, which brings in H-2A laborers to work on farms in need of temporary workers. This year, the companyâ€™s owner, Steve Scaroni, says he expects to bring in about 4,000 workers.  Companies like Fresh Harvest are attractive for farmers who want to employ legal workers but do not want to deal with the considerable government red tape and regulations associated with the H-2A program. Employers who bring in workers on the visas must provide them with free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Still, Scaroni says he could find work for even more people if he had enough housing. While use of the H-2A program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the United States, according to government data.

0345,U.S. lawmakers ask Trump to turn over any Comey tapes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Sunday called on President Donald Trump to turn over any tapes of conversations with fired FBI chief James Comey, potentially setting up a showdown with the White House as Democrats considered a boycott of the vote on Comeyâ€™s replacement. In a highly unusual move, Trump last week appeared to suggest on Twitter that he might have tapes of conversations with Comey and warned the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation against talking to the media. Trump and a White House spokesman declined to confirm or deny whether such tapes exist. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the White House must â€œclear the airâ€?about whether there are any taped conversations. â€œYou canâ€™t be cute about tapes. If there are any tapes of this conversation, they need to be turned over,â€?Graham told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Pressâ€?program.  Trump sparked a political firestorm when he abruptly fired  Comey last week. The FBI has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Democrats have accused Trump of attempting to thwart the FBIâ€™s probe and have called for some type of independent inquiry into the matter.  Trump has said he removed Comey because he was not doing a good job and that Comey had lost the support of FBI employees. Trump tweeted on Friday that â€œJames Comey better hope that there are no â€˜tapesâ€?of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!â€?If there are recordings, Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah told the â€œFox News Sundayâ€?program it was â€œinevitableâ€?that they would be subpoenaed and the White House would have to release them. Lee, who was on Trumpâ€™s list of potential replacements for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, also said recording conversations in the White House is â€œnot necessarily the best idea.â€?  Trumpâ€™s threat about tapes has intensified calls from Democrats for an independent probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.     Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump must immediately provide Congress with any tapes and warned that destroying existing tapes would violate the law. Schumer also said Senate Democrats are weighing whether to refuse to vote on a new FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate Trumpâ€™s potential ties to Russia. Russia has denied the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. â€œTo have that special prosecutor, people would breathe a sigh of relief because then there would be a real independent person overlooking the FBI director,â€?Schumer told CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€?program. Trump, who has sought better relations with Russia, has continued to question whether it was behind the hacking of email accounts belonging to Democrats involved in Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Pressâ€?program there is no question that â€œthe Russians were playing around in our electoral processes.â€?He defended Trumpâ€™s decision to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office last week. â€œItâ€™s in the interest of the American people, itâ€™s in the interest of Russia and the rest of the world that we do something to see if we cannot improve the relationship between the two greatest nuclear powers in the world,â€?Tillerson said.     The Justice Department began interviewing candidates for the FBI director job on Saturday. Some people under consideration include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, according to a White House official. Meanwhile, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday found that 29 percent of Americans approve of Trumpâ€™s decision to fire Comey, while 38 percent disapprove. If a Senate vote on a new FBI director breaks down along party lines, Democrats would not have the votes to block a nominee because Republicans hold a majority in the chamber. â€œThe key is getting some of our Republican colleagues to join us,â€?Schumer said. Republican leaders in the Senate have rebuffed calls for a special prosecutor, saying it would interfere with ongoing congressional probes. Graham said there may come a time when a special prosecutor is needed but not now. â€œRight now, it is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. So you donâ€™t need a special prosecutor,â€?Graham said on â€œMeet the Press.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/14,1
0346,Trump reassures farmers immigration crackdown not aimed at their workers,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the U.S. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.     At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           â€œHe assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,â€?said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as â€œvery productive.â€?The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.  About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s National Agriculture Workersâ€?Survey.  During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House.  Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor â€œthan about anything else we talked about,â€Â Â said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowaâ€™s secretary of agriculture. Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. â€œI brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,â€?he said. â€œIf the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.â€?While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in Californiaâ€™s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.Â  For a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs/2qdtfnb Trump recently signed another executive order titled â€œBuy American, Hire American,â€?calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trumpâ€™s own resorts. Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. â€œHe has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,â€?said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolinaâ€™s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a â€œblue cardâ€?to protect them from deportation.  Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the presidentâ€™s support to make it a bipartisan effort.  â€œThe administration has got something started here,â€?he said of the meeting with farm leaders. â€œItâ€™s about time something happens.â€Â?

0347,Trump considering how move of U.S. Embassy in Israel could affect Mideast peace,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is trying to determine how keeping his promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem could affect his hopes of brokering a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, his secretary of state said on Sunday. Since taking office in January, Trump has shown signs of shelving his campaign pledge to move the embassy from Tel Aviv, while vowing to do what is necessary to clinch a Middle East peace agreement. â€œThe president is being very careful to understand how such a decision would impact a peace process,â€?Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€?He spoke just days before Trump starts a Middle East trip that includes meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all foreign countries to base their embassies there. The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies as the Palestinians also claim the city as their capital. Tillerson said Trumpâ€™s decision would depend greatly on how it is seen by governments in the region, including â€œwhether Israel views it as being helpful to a peace initiative or perhaps a distraction.â€?His comments drew a quick response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. â€œIsraelâ€™s position has been stated many times before to the American administration and the world,â€?Netanyahuâ€™s office said in a statement. â€œMoving the American embassy to Jerusalem will not harm the peace process, it will do the opposite. It will advance it by righting a historical wrong and by shattering the Palestinian fantasy that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel.â€? ",politicsNews,2017/5/14,1

0349,Trump pledges to move quickly to name new FBI director,"WASHINGTON/LYNCHBURG, Va. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new FBI director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. Trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed James Comey to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. â€œEven that is possible,â€?Trump said, speaking on Air Force One before departing for Lynchburg, Virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. â€œI think the process is going to go quickly,â€?he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. â€œTheyâ€™ve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And thatâ€™s what we want for the FBI.â€?Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly dismissing Comey, who was leading the agencyâ€™s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.. Russia denies the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. Trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at Liberty University in Lynchburg, where he did not mention Comey or the controversy his dismissal on Tuesday caused. It was Trumpâ€™s first public event outside the White House since Comeyâ€™s ouster. A White House official had said 11 people were under consideration - including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher - to replace Comey as FBI chief. Two new names, however, emerged on Saturday: FBI special agent Adam Lee and U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson. A source familiar with the process said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had interviewed Hudson, Lee and five others on Saturday. The FBI Agents Association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on Saturday endorsed another candidate: former Representative Mike Rogers, who had also worked as an FBI agent. At Liberty, the nationâ€™s largest Christian college, Trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti-establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge â€œentrenched interests.â€?He thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory.  â€œRelish the opportunity to be an outsider,â€?Trump said. â€œThe more that a broken system tells you that youâ€™re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.â€?He also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. â€œNo one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it canâ€™t be done,â€?Trump said. â€œNothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because theyâ€™re people that canâ€™t get the job done.â€? Libertyâ€™s president, Jerry Falwell, Jr., was a key early supporter of Trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives.  Trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip - one that will take him to the Middle East and Europe - also will deliver the commencement address to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, on Wednesday.

0350,Factbox: The 11 candidates being considered for FBI director,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering 11 people to replace fired FBI Director James Comey, according to a White House official, and the Department of Justice will begin interviewing people on Friday or during the weekend. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing that Trump would fill the job â€œas soon as he finds a candidate that fits the qualities that he feels are necessary to lead the FBI.â€?The pick will be under intense scrutiny since Comey was fired while leading the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe of possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. Here are the 11 people under consideration:  Kelly was New York Cityâ€™s police commissioner longer than any other person. Although the city saw historic drops in crime under his leadership, there is some controversy over his use of stop-and-frisk, an anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband. Trump has praised that method. The former FBI agent was a congressman from Michigan until 2015 and served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Rogers also briefly advised Trumpâ€™s transition team on national security issues. Fisher was an assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice under former President George W. Bush. She currently works at the law firm Latham & Watkins. Gowdy is a House representative from South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor. He led a two-year special congressional committee investigation that accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâ€™s State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya.  The Republican senator from Texas is the Senateâ€™s second-ranking member. He previously was Texas attorney general.  Abbate has long worked in the FBI and currently serves as the executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. Before that, he was the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office.  The former New York prosecutor currently serves as an associate judge on the New York Court of Appeals.  Suthers is the former Colorado attorney general and the current mayor of Colorado Springs, Colorado. He also was the executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections. Luttig, a former Justice Department lawyer and appellate court judge, has served as executive vice president and general counsel of Boeing since 2006. Thompson was U.S. deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 under Bush. He also served as senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel for PepsiCo.  McCabe became acting director of the FBI this week following Trumpâ€™s abrupt firing of Comey. Until Tuesday, he was the bureauâ€™s deputy director. ",politicsNews,2017/5/12,1

0353,Trump to back Palestinian 'self-determination' on Mideast trip: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will express support for Palestinian â€œself-determinationâ€?during a Middle East trip this month, a senior aide said on Friday, suggesting Trump is open to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict despite not having publicly embraced the idea so far. The comment by U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster came just nine days after a White House visit by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in which Trump vowed to seek a historic peace deal but stopped short of explicitly recommitting to the eventual goal of Palestinian statehood, a longtime bedrock of U.S. policy. Previewing Trumpâ€™s first foreign trip, McMaster also said he would use a visit to Saudi Arabia, his first stop, to encourage Arab and Muslim partners to take â€œbold new stepsâ€?to confront those from Iran, Islamic State, al Qaeda and Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s government â€œwho perpetuate chaos and violence.â€?Trumpâ€™s travels, which begin late next week and will also  include stops in Israel and Rome, are intended to â€œbroadcast a message of unityâ€?by visiting holy sites of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, McMaster told reporters. Trumpâ€™s meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, currently due to be held separately, will be closely watched for whether he begins to articulate a cohesive strategy to revive long-stalled negotiations. Most experts are skeptical of Trumpâ€™s chances of brokering a peace accord that eluded his predecessors. Trump plans, in talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to â€œreaffirm Americaâ€™s unshakeable bond to the Jewish stateâ€?and in a meeting with Abbas to â€œexpress his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians,â€?said McMaster, a decorated Army general with extensive Middle East experience. Trump is expected to meet Abbas, the Western-backed head of the Palestinian Authority, in Bethlehem in the West Bank, Palestinian sources say. Palestinians were disappointed when Trump failed to mention a two-state solution in a joint appearance with Abbas on May 3. Trump sparked international criticism in February when, during a news conference with Netanyahu, he appeared to back away from a longstanding U.S. commitment to Palestinian statehood, saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide. An independent state is not only the aspiration of the vast majority of Palestinians but has been the objective of successive U.S. administrations and the international community. Asked whether Trump would bring Netanyahu and Abbas together in the same room during the visit scheduled for May 22-23, McMaster said that would be up to the president and the other leaders. â€œThe final plans arenâ€™t set yet,â€?he said.

0359,"U.S., EU set meeting on airline security, electronic devices","WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. and European officials will discuss airline security issues at a meeting in Brussels next week, including possibly expanding the number of airports that ban passengers from carrying electronic devices bigger than cellphones aboard flights, a European Commission spokeswoman said on Friday. U.S. Homeland Security Department Secretary John Kelly told European ministers by phone Friday the department does not plan to immediately unveil any new measures, the EU said. U.S. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said no final decision had been made on whether to expand the restrictions, and he declined to immediately confirm Kellyâ€™s trip to Brussels. â€œThe U.S. and the EU are on the same side when it comes to fighting terrorism and protecting our security,â€?Dimitris Avramopoulos, EU commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said in a statement.  â€œOur phone call today proved once again the strong cooperation we have on these matters. I look forward to welcoming Mr Kelly and his experts in Brussels next week to continue our positive talks.â€?Fears that a bomb could be concealed in electronic devices prompted the United States to announce in March that it would restrict passengers from bringing laptops onto flights originating from 10 airports, including those in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Britain followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.         Airlines and several countries affected by the electronics ban have pushed for more consultation with American and British regulators after the abrupt introduction of the restrictions took the industry by surprise. U.S. and European carriers are concerned about the logistics of checking large numbers of devices. Some airline officials say they would need to hire more staff to impose additional curbs and are worried about how much advance notice they would have. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is likely to include some European countries in the in-cabin electronics ban.  Some U.S. and European airlines have been planning for a wider ban, industry officials have told Reuters. European regulators have warned that placing hundreds of devices in the hold on long-haul flights could also compromise safety by increasing the risk of fire from poorly deactivated lithium-ion batteries. The EU said in a document approved Thursday and reviewed by Reuters that it did not â€œhave information that would require the adoption of additional security measures, such as the restrictions being considered by the U.S authorities.â€?The EU document added that placing laptops in luggage holds â€œpresents an increased safety risk to the aircraft, due to the lithium batteries contained in such devices.â€?Kelly briefed members of Congress on Thursday and held a meeting with high-level executives of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), United Airlines (UAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and Airlines For America, a trade group. A congressional official said Homeland Security was likely to expand the ban soon but did not say when or to what airports. The airlines declined to comment, but an airline official said government officials suggested an expansion of the ban was expected soon but it wasnâ€™t certain when.  The trade group said in a statement it appreciated the meeting â€œto discuss the current state of aviation security.â€?The group voted to work with government officials to â€œminimize the impact on the traveling public by utilizing the risk-based solutions that are the core of our foundation as the safest aviation system in the world.â€?In 2016, 30 million people flew to the United States from Europe, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. According to airports association ACI Europe, summer schedules for 2017 at airports in 28 European Union countries show there are 3,257 flights per week to the United States. Kelly said last month the ban was likely to expand, given the sophisticated threats in aviation and intelligence findings that would-be attackers were trying to hide explosives in electronic devices. The predicament is reminiscent of the aviation industryâ€™s response to the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.  At the time, airlines called for greater sharing of information about potential threats to commercial aircraft from conflict zones, even as intelligence agencies expressed reluctance over the risk of revealing sources.

0360,Trump's lawyers say tax returns show little income from Russian sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A review of President Donald Trumpâ€™s tax returns from the past 10 years showed no income from Russian sources outside of a few exceptions, and indicated he did not owe money to Russian lenders, his lawyers said in a letter released by the White House on Friday. The letter, dated March 8, said the tax returns did not reflect any Trump income from Russian sources, aside from money earned during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and the 2008 sale of a Florida estate to a Russian billionaire.  Trumpâ€™s businesses also may have earned â€œimmaterialâ€?amounts of money from Russians over the years through ordinary sales transactions, including condominium rentals or sales, hotel rooms, rounds of golf, or sales of Trump-licensed products, Sheri Dillon and William Nelson, attorneys at Morgan Lewis and Bockius, said in the letter. The tax returns also did not reflect any payments by Trump or his businesses to Russian lenders, any Trump investments in Russian firms or any investment by Russians in Trumpâ€™s companies, the letter said. Morgan Lewis, a global law firm with 30 offices in cities around the world including New York and Moscow, was named Russia Law Firm of the Year in 2016 by London-based Chambers and Partners, a firm that ranks lawyers and law firms. The release of the letter by Trumpâ€™s long-time attorneys came as the president sought to calm the furor caused by his firing this week of FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia to influence the U.S. election. Comeyâ€™s firing on Tuesday and the White Houseâ€™s shifting explanations about the rationale for the move have raised concerns among Democrats and others that the White House was trying to blunt the FBI probe. Trump and the White House have denied any such motive, but Trump told NBC on Thursday that the Russia probe was on his mind when he made the decision to fire the FBI director.     Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he wanted to know more about Trumpâ€™s business dealings with Russia and intended to examine whether any connections existed between Russia and the Trump campaign or the presidentâ€™s associates. The White House welcomed the fact-finding effort by Graham and a subcommittee he chairs. â€œHe has no business in Russia; he has no connections to Russia,â€?White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, adding that the president had directed his law firm to send Graham a certified letter stating as much.

The afternoon meeting included high level executives from Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), United Airlines Inc (UAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and trade group Airlines for America, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the confidential meeting. The airlines and group declined to comment. In March, the United States announced laptop restrictions on flights originating from 10 airports including in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey because of fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken onto aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.  The Trump administration is likely to include some European countries in the in-cabin ban on gadgets larger than cellphones and is reviewing how to ensure lithium batteries stored in luggage do not explode in midair, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan declined to discuss the meeting. He said on Wednesday that no final decision had been made on expanding the restriction and there would be no announcement on Thursday. One issue that had been expected to come up at the meeting was how much advance notice airlines would get to impose additional restrictions, which some airline officials say would require hiring more staff. In 2016, 30 million people flew to the United States from Europe, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. A broader ban would have a significant impact U.S. and European carriers, which are concerned about the challenges of checking large numbers of devices. Some U.S. and European airlines have been planning for a wider ban, industry officials have told Reuters. Earlier Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly met with senators from relevant oversight committees in a secure Capitol Hill facility to deliver a classified briefing to discuss numerous security issues â€œincluding threats to aviation,â€?Lapan said. A congresional official said it appeared that Homeland Securitiy was likely to expand the ban soon, but did not say when or to what airports. Kelly said last month the ban was likely to expand, given the sophisticated threats in aviation and intelligence findings that would-be attackers were trying to hide explosives in electronic devices.

0363,Kushner Cos says to skip China marketing push this weekend,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The company owned by the family of senior White House aide Jared Kushner will skip roadshow events in China this weekend seeking money from local investors for a real estate project in exchange for a shot at U.S. immigrant visas, a company spokesman said. Nicole Kushner Meyer, Jaredâ€™s sister, appeared at marketing events last weekend in Beijing and Shanghai in an effort to raise $150 million from Chinese investors through the controversial EB-5 visa-for-investment program. According to marketing materials from one of the organizers of the roadshow, sales events for the project are scheduled in the southern cities of Shenzhen on Saturday and Guangzhou on Sunday. â€œNo one from Kushner Companies will be in China this weekend,â€?James Yolles, spokesman for the firm, said. The company and KABR Group are raising money for a two-tower apartment complex in New Jersey called One Journal Square, marketing materials showed. Kushner Companies earlier this week apologized for Meyer having mentioned Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, in discussing the project. The company said Meyer had done so only in an attempt to make clear that her brother was not involved. â€œKushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyerâ€™s intention,â€?it said. In addition to Meyer, Laurent Morali, president of Kushner Companies, was included in marketing materials online for the China road show. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year. The EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. A member of the audience at the marketing event in Shanghai said Meyer spoke for about 10 minutes during last Sundayâ€™s event and described her familyâ€™s humble roots. According to the New York Times, in Beijing on Saturday she told the audience of about 100 people the project â€œmeans a lot to me and my entire familyâ€? ",politicsNews,2017/5/12,1
0364,Trump attacks on fired FBI chief meet resistance; Russia probe proceeds," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday ran into resistance for calling ousted FBI chief James Comey a â€œshowboat,â€?an attack that was swiftly contradicted by top U.S. senators and the acting FBI leader, who pledged that an investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia would proceed with vigor.  In his first interview since firing Comey on Tuesday, Trump appeared to try to underscore that Comeyâ€™s dismissal was about his performance at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and not about the Russia probe.  Trump faces accusations from Democrats that he fired Comey to hinder the FBI investigation into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. The probe has hung over Trumpâ€™s presidency since he took office in January and threatens to overwhelm his policy priorities.  â€œHeâ€™s a showboat. Heâ€™s a grandstander,â€?Trump told NBC News. â€œThe FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that, everybody knows that.â€? Trumpâ€™s characterization was at odds with that of the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  At a hearing on Thursday, the Republican chairman of the panel, Richard Burr, and the top Democrat, Mark Warner, praised Comey. Warner said he was offended at Trumpâ€™s remarks.  Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, testifying in place of Comey, contradicted Trumpâ€™s appraisal of turmoil at the FBI, saying that Comey had â€œbroad supportâ€?from the rank and file â€œand still does to this day.â€? A White House spokeswoman on Thursday morning had said that Trump was expected to soon visit FBI headquarters, but MSNBC later reported that plan had been thrown out after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly following his firing of Comey.  Several candidates are being considered to replace Comey, a senior White House official said, including Mike Rogers, a former Republican representative; Trey Gowdy, a Republican representative and former federal prosecutor; Alice Fisher, assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration; and Ray Kelly, former commissioner of the New York Police Department.  The nominee must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  McCabe promised to tell senators of any White House meddling into the agencyâ€™s probe on Russia. Democrats have called for a special counsel to look into the matter.  â€œIt is my opinion and belief that the FBI will continue to pursue this investigation vigorously and completely,â€?McCabe told the senators.  Moscow has denied interference in the election, and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.  In firing Comey, Trump said he knew he ran the risk he would â€œconfuse peopleâ€?and â€œlengthen out the investigationâ€?into ties to Russia.  â€œIn fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, â€˜You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, itâ€™s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,â€?he told NBC.  Trump said in the interview that he never pressured Comey into dropping the FBI probe, adding: â€œIf Russia did anything, I want to know that.â€?Trump said there was no â€œcollusion between me and my campaign and the Russians,â€?but that â€œthe Russians did not affect the vote.â€? His explanation of why he fired Comey ran counter to previous administration explanations of Comeyâ€™s dismissal.  The White House and Vice President Mike Pence had said Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and No. 2 Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein.  On Thursday, Trump said he would have taken the action regardless. â€œI was going to fire Comey. My decision,â€?Trump said. â€œI was going to fire regardless of recommendation.â€? Rosenstein, who met privately with some senators on Thursday, was invited to brief all 100 senators next week, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. Schumer said he hoped that Sessions would also speak to senators separately on the firing of Comey.  In the House of Representatives, Justin Amash, a Republican member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Twitter that he had signed onto Democratic-sponsored legislation calling for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russian meddling in last yearâ€™s U.S. election campaign.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to disrupt the election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump.  Leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA chief Mike Pompeo, testified to the senators on Thursday that they agreed with that finding.  Trump, in his interview, also gave further details of his account that Comey had told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation in the Russia matter.  Trump said he had asked Comey once over dinner and twice by telephone. â€œI said: â€˜If itâ€™s possible, would you let me know, am I under investigation?â€™â€?Trump told NBC. â€œHe said: â€˜You are not under investigation.â€™â€? Trump said the dinner with Comey was at the White House and Comey wanted to discuss staying on as FBI chief. â€œWe had a very nice dinner. And at that time, he told me: â€˜You are not under investigation.â€™â€? White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she believed it was not a conflict of interest for a president to ask the FBI chief such a question.  Comey has not publicly discussed any conversations he had with Trump.  At the Senate hearing, McCabe testified it was not typical practice to tell people they were not a targets of an investigation.  Republican chairman Burr asked McCabe whether he ever heard Comey tell Trump that the president was not the subject of investigation. McCabe sidestepped the question, saying he could not comment on an ongoing probe.  Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said it was â€œhard to avoid the conclusionâ€?that Trumpâ€™s firing of Comey was related to the Russia investigation.  â€œAnd while itâ€™s clear to me now more than ever that an independent special counsel must be appointed, make no mistake our committee will get to the bottom of what happened during the 2016 presidential election,â€?Warner said.

0365,U.S. Senate confirms Trump trade representative ahead of NAFTA talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for U.S. Trade Representative, a critical position ahead of renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Delays in Senate confirmation of veteran trade lawyer Robert Lighthizer more than 100 days after his nomination have set back Trumpâ€™s trade agenda, including the start of talks about revamping one of the worldâ€™s biggest trading blocs. Lighthizer won support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Republican-led Senate on Thursday, with an 82-14 vote to confirm his nomination.   The administration has had to wait for Lighthizer to be in place before triggering the formal process to begin renegotiating NAFTA.  It was not immediately clear when the White House would begin that process. To do so, the Trump administration must send a letter to Congress declaring its intention to launch  negotiations in 90 days. The Republican president has said the 23-year-old trade pact devastated U.S. workers and has vowed to tear it up if he fails to get a better deal.  Some Democrats, while critical of Trumpâ€™s views on trade, said they were confident Lighthizer would work to help U.S. workers. â€œHeâ€™s a real pro,â€?Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said before voting in favor. Lighthizerâ€™s approval came despite the objections of two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said they were worried he did not appreciate NAFTAâ€™s benefits. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, in charge of trade ties with the United States, said she did not expect the administration would move immediately on NAFTA. â€œI imagine that Ambassador Lighthizer may need to spend a bit of time in consultations prior to formally triggering that 90-day period,â€?she said on a conference call on Thursday night.      While the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico has ballooned since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, U.S. farmers have profited from exports to Americaâ€™s southern neighbor, while automakers have cut costs by building cross-border supply chains that benefit from lower Mexican wages.  Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee and voted in favor of Lighthizerâ€™s nomination, also urged the incoming trade representative not to put at risk the gains NAFTA had brought.  â€œThere are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA,â€?Hatch said. â€œBut it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/11,1
0366,Senators pledge aggressive Russia probe after meeting with U.S. Justice Department's No. 2,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday vowed to press ahead with their investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election as aggressively as possible despite turmoil over the firing of the FBI director. The panelâ€™s Republican Chairman Richard Burr and ranking Democrat Mark Warner made the comments to reporters following a meeting with U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the wake of President Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of James Comey this week. ,politicsNews,2017/5/11,1
0367,What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign to benefit Trump. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a â€œclear preferenceâ€?for Trump to win the White House. Putinâ€™s  associates hacked information, paid social media â€œtrollsâ€?and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. What has Trump said about Russiaâ€™s role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  â€œI will tell you this, Russia: if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,â€?Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to a FBI probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. â€œAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,â€?Trump said, although he then added: â€œIt could have been others also.â€?Earlier this month, Trump said China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. How many U.S. probes are there into Russiaâ€™s election meddling?  Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are all known to be investigating. Some Democrats and Trump critics have also called on the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts  with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, was fired  in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the  first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn after he declined to voluntarily comply with an earlier request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Will the FBI probe continue after Comeyâ€™s dismissal? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscowâ€™s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. It was the first time he publicly acknowledged the agency was investigating the matter. Comeyâ€™s departure does not necessarily mean the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation will be disrupted or ended as the career FBI officials Comey put in charge of it will likely continue working on the matter even as the search for a new director begins. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee had raised concerns about the pace of the FBI inquiry before Comeyâ€™s firing. The congressional probes are dependent on the intelligence produced by the FBI and other agencies. FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe, who will lead the agency until a new director is hired, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeyâ€™s firing will not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Why was Comey fired? Attorney General Sessions sent Trump a May 9 letter attaching a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on â€œRestoring Confidence in the FBIâ€?that recommended Comeyâ€™s dismissal. Rosensteinâ€™s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteinâ€™s view was that Comeyâ€™s decision to make a public statement on the matter broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a â€œshowboatâ€?and â€œgrandstanderâ€?in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosensteinâ€™s recommendation.  Did Comeyâ€™s firing have anything to do with the Russia probe? The White House says Comey was dismissed because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation. But many Democrats challenged that and some Republicans have expressed skepticism given the delay between Trump taking office on Jan. 20 and Comeyâ€™s dismissal. Trump aides have told Reuters that top Justice Department officials wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say during a May 3 congressional hearing about the FBIâ€™s investigation of Clintonâ€™s private email system.  The hearing was just days after Clinton said at a New York event that announcements by Comey in October 2016, a week before the election that he had re-opened, and then re-closed, the email probe had swung the election for Trump. Comey told the congressional panel the idea that he may have affected the election result made him â€œmildly nauseous.â€?Just days before his firing, Comey asked Rosenstein for a significant boost in resources to fund the agencyâ€™s Russia probe, according to media reports. The Justice Department has denied this request was made. Is Trump being investigated by the FBI?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has never stated publicly whether or not the FBI was investigating Trump and it would be unorthodox for him to say such a thing to the president. The White House has offered no proof to back Trumpâ€™s claim. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. â€œThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?â€?he wrote on Twitter on May 8.

0368,New York mayor criticized for proposed limits on legal aid to immigrants,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City public defenders on Thursday criticized a proposal by Mayor Bill de Blasio to deny free legal counsel to immigrants in deportation hearings if they had been convicted of serious crimes in the past, saying the plan would deny them due process. In his proposed annual budget, De Blasio allocated $16.4 million to legal services for immigrant New Yorkers, citing concern about U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.  Lawyers, local lawmakers and civil rights activists welcomed the funding proposal, which sharply increases legal aid for immigrants. But they gathered on the steps of City Hall to criticize a provision they said would unfairly deprive some people of the right to due process under the law.  De Blasioâ€™s proposal would deny city-funded lawyers to immigrants previously convicted of one of 170 crimes that the city considers serious or violent.   Jennifer Friedman, who runs the immigration practice at Bronx Defenders, said the mayorâ€™s plan would create a â€œtwo-tier system that treats people different based on their criminal history.â€?The funding be in addition to the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project (NYIFUP), which has been funded by the City Council since 2013 and provides free lawyers to immigrants facing deportation hearings at the federal immigration court.  In the United States, the right to a lawyer does not extend to federal immigration hearings which are civil, not criminal, proceedings.  The plan contradicted de Blasioâ€™s description of New York as a â€œsanctuary cityâ€?for immigrants, the public defenders said. Seth Stein, a City Hall spokesman, wrote in an email that â€œthe public should not be expected to foot the billâ€?for immigrants convicted of dangerous crimes. â€œThe vast majority of immigrants have not been convicted of violent crimes,â€?he wrote. More than 2,000 immigrants have received free lawyers under the council-funded program, which provides free lawyers regardless of an immigrantâ€™s criminal record, in the four years since it began, Legal Aid said.  In New York City, immigrants without lawyers managed to overturn a removal order in court only 3 percent of the time, while those with lawyers were able to remain in the country 30 percent of the time, Legal Aid said.

0369,U.S. consumer watchdog's prepaid-card rule survives Congress challenge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major challenge to the U.S. watchdog for consumer finances fizzled on Thursday, as Congress missed a deadline to repeal the agencyâ€™s new rule on prepaid cards. Late last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule requiring greater disclosures and overdraft limits for the cards sold by companies such as Mastercard Inc. (MA.N) and Greendot and frequently used in place of paychecks. The timing made the rule eligible for Congress to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), but lawmakers only had until Thursday to kill the regulation by passing a disapproval resolution in both chambers with simple majorities. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia, one of the agencyâ€™s biggest critics, had introduced a resolution that he tried to speed through his chamber, but congressional aides and advocacy groups said he could not gather enough votes. Perdue has repeatedly said the CFPB, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals against fraud, oversteps its authority. Earlier this week he said he intends to keep up pressure on the agency.  The resolutionâ€™s failure indicates that future regulations from the CFPB, reviled by many Republicans, may have shots at survival. The agency is led by Democrat Richard Cordray, was created by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and was originally conceived by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leader in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The CFPB was expected to soon finalize restrictions on the fine print in contracts known as â€œmandatory arbitration clausesâ€?that require consumers to give up their rights to class-action lawsuits as a condition of buying a service or product. But the ruleâ€™s fate has been caught in limbo. Congress is expected to kill it swiftly with a CRA resolution once it is official. While the first half-dozen CRA resolutions flew easily through Congress, repealing a wide spectrum of Obama-era regulations, the final resolutions faced a tougher time. One limiting methane emissions from oil and gas production on public lands failed on Wednesday. All told, Congress killed 14 regulations since Feb. 1. Lawmakers could still vote after this week to repeal rules that Obama finished in the last six months of his administration, but they will need super-majorities in each chamber, which is nearly impossible to achieve in the more closely divided Senate.

0370,Trump signs order aimed at upgrading government cyber defenses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to bolster the governmentâ€™s cyber security and protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, marking his first significant action to address what he has called a top priority. The order seeks to improve the often-maligned network security of U.S. government agencies, from which foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other forms of sensitive data in recent years. The White House said the order also aimed to enhance protection of infrastructure such as the energy grid and financial sector from sophisticated attacks that officials have warned could pose a national security threat or cripple parts of the economy. The directive, which drew largely favorable reviews from cyber experts and industry groups, also lays out goals to develop a more robust cyber deterrence strategy, in part by forging strong cooperation with U.S. allies in cyberspace. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said the order sought to build on efforts undertaken by the former Obama administration.  Among the notable changes, heads of federal agencies must use a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assess and manage cyber risk, and prepare a report within 90 days documenting how they will implement it. The Obama administration had encouraged the private sector to adopt the voluntary NIST framework. But it did not require government agencies to do so, which opened it up to criticism as it frequently scrambled to respond to major hacks, such as the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from the Office of Personnel Management. Government agencies would now â€œpractice what they preach,â€?Bossert told reporters during a White House briefing. â€œA lot of progress was made in the last administration, but not nearly enough.â€?Michael Daniel, who served as White House cyber security coordinator under former Democratic President Barack Obama, generally praised the order but said it was largely â€œa plan for a plan.â€?Trump, a Republican, has also asked agencies to review their federal workforceâ€™s cyber talent, an area where the government has faced a growing shortfall of qualified personnel in recent years. The order calls for an examination of the impact of moving agencies toward a shared information technology environment, such as through cloud computing services. It also urges voluntary cooperation with the private sector to develop better strategies to fend off and reduce attacks from botnets, or  networks of infected devices. Trump nearly signed a cyber security measure just days into his presidency in January, but it was pulled back to allow for more input from federal agencies and consultation with experts. Before taking office, Trump said he intended to make cyber security a priority of his administration. But he has raised alarm among cyber security experts by frequently using a personal Twitter that could be hacked by an adversary. His skepticism of the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked Democratic emails during the election to help him win has drawn criticism. Russia has repeatedly denied assertions it used cyber means to meddle in the U.S. election. Bossert said Russiaâ€™s alleged hacks were not a motivation for the order, adding that â€œthe Russians are not our only adversary on the internet.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/11,1
0371,Former U.S. Representative Brown of Florida found guilty of fraud,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. Representative Corrine Brown of Florida was found guilty in federal court on Thursday of fraud for helping to raise $800,000 for a bogus charity and using the funds for concerts and golf, U.S. Justice Department officials said. Brown, 70, was convicted on 18 counts of participating in a conspiracy involving a fraudulent education charity, concealing material facts required on financial disclosure forms and filing false tax returns, the Justice Department said in a statement. â€œFormer Congresswoman Brown chose greed and personal gain over the sacred trust given to her by the community that she served for many years,â€?acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow said after a jury reached a verdict in Jacksonville. Brown, a Democrat who served 24 years in Congress, lost her re-election bid last year after being indicted. Her sentencing date has not been set. James Smith, her attorney, told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Jacksonville that he would seek a new trial. â€œShe maintains her innocence,â€?he said. â€œThis is just part one of a very long process.â€?Prosecutors said Brown participated from 2012 to 2016 in a conspiracy and fraud scheme involving the One Door for Education fund, along with her chief-of-staff Elias â€œRonnieâ€?Simmons and the charityâ€™s president, Carla Wiley. The group solicited more than $800,000 in charitable donations that they said would be used to pay for college scholarships, computers for schools and other charitable causes, prosecutors said.    The money instead was spent by the three for their own personal use, including for a golf tournament honoring Brown and for luxury box seats at a Beyonce concert. The charity awarded only two scholarships totaling $1,200 to college students, according to trial evidence. Simmons and Wiley previously pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their involvement in the scheme.      Brown, known as a talkative politician who does not shy away from the media, stayed silent as she left the courthouse on Thursday. Brown was elected to Congress in 1992 as one of the first three black members of Floridaâ€™s congressional delegation since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War.

0372,Illinois lawmakers delay bill to expand abortion as veto looms,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers in Illinois on Thursday said they have placed on hold a bill that expands state-funded coverage of abortions for low-income residents and state employees but faces a likely veto from the stateâ€™s Republican governor.  The bill, which received final passage in a 33-22 state Senate vote on Wednesday, also aims to keep abortions legal in Illinois if the U.S. Supreme Court follows President Donald Trumpâ€™s call to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortions legal 44 years ago.  Democratic state Senator Don Harmon filed a motion Wednesday night to reconsider the Senateâ€™s vote, meaning the bill will not immediately be sent to Governor Bruce Rauner.  â€œThis measure is too important to immediately put it in the hands of a governor whose public opinions about womenâ€™s access to safe, affordable reproductive health care have been inconsistent at best,â€?Harmon said in a statement on Thursday. The Senate can hold the bill for the duration of the legislative session, said Harmon spokeswoman Jayette Bolinski.   Illinoisâ€?Medicaid program covers abortions in cases of rape, incest and when a motherâ€™s life or health is threatened. The expansion would enable poor women to obtain elective abortions. Also, the legislation would allow state employees to have the procedures covered under state health insurance. A spokeswoman for Rauner declined to comment on Thursday. Rauner, who faces re-election next year, has promised to veto the legislation, saying Illinois should focus on less â€œdivisiveâ€?issues and instead pass a full-year operating budget for the first time in nearly two years. A veto would be a sharp turn from his previous position, which political opponents are poised to exploit. As a candidate in 2014, he supported expanding abortion access.  Illinois, the countryâ€™s fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history. Rauner has feuded with Democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence a state budget be tied to his list of policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits, freeze property taxes and impose new rules on injured workers seeking compensation from their employers.

0374,White House weeks away from naming anyone to Fed: official,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is weeks away from naming anyone to the board of the Federal Reserve, a White House official said, meaning it could be the fall before three currently empty seats are filled. The vacancies on the Fedâ€™s seven member Board of Governors include the position of vice chair in charge of banking oversight, a critical role in Trumpâ€™s plan to revamp financial rules. The White House wants to get all nominees vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Government Ethics before they name them publicly and that process can take months, according to people familiar with the matter. If the vetting drags on, it runs the risk of delaying those people from taking their jobs until sometime this fall, complicating Trumpâ€™s plan to reshape regulation of Wall Street. The Fed positions require confirmation by the Senate and could be delayed further by a five-week congressional recess from the end of July to the beginning of September. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be Trumpâ€™s pick for the Fedâ€™s top bank regulator, Reuters has previously reported. Trump met him late last month, according to sources familiar with the matter. Quarles, who worked as a partner at private equity firm the Carlyle Group, currently runs a private investment firm, the Cynosure Group, from Salt Lake City, Utah. He also served in the Treasury Department under Bush and was the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund. Quarles did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The vice chair for supervision and regulation and another seat that governs community banking were created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law but were never filled by President Barack Obama. Former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo had stepped in to fill the supervision void before leaving the central bank in April. The White House would like to name all three regulatory positions at the Fed at the same time, according to people familiar with the matter. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dismissed that idea publicly last month, saying, â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to do that.â€?In addition to the three current vacancies, one of which must be filled by someone with community banking experience, Chair Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. Trump could therefore fill as many as five of the boardâ€™s seven seats within the next year, giving him the opportunity to nominate a block of people who will have a big say in the direction of interest rates.

0376,"Trump creates panel to study voter fraud, suppression","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump created a commission on Thursday to investigate voter fraud and suppression, the White House said, a move that follows Trumpâ€™s unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump signed an executive order creating the bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which would be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. The move provoked anger among top U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, who called it a voter suppression tactic. Trump, who took office in January, has said there was  widespread voter fraud in the November election. The Republican won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but lost the popular vote to  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by some 3 million ballots. Trump said in January he would seek an investigation into voter fraud in the election, even though the consensus among state officials and election experts is that it is rare in the United States. â€œThe Presidentâ€™s â€˜Election Integrityâ€?Commission is purpose-built to encourage and enable voter suppression,â€?said U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a statement. She said the commission would lend legitimacy to state efforts to enact discriminatory voting laws. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued similar statements. Top civil rights leaders said the commission would encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers like requiring identity cards for voting.  â€œWhen Attorney General Jeff Sessions led a similar effort as a former prosecutor in Alabama, it had a chilling effect on the black vote,â€?said Kristen Clarke, the head of the Lawyersâ€?Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.  Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union voting project, said, â€œSigning a piece of paper will not make Trumpâ€™s false statements about voter fraud true.â€?The bipartisan commission would not be limited to investigating Trumpâ€™s election fraud claims but look at issues that have been raised over many years.  â€œThe commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American peopleâ€™s confidence in the integrity of federal elections, and provide the president with a report that identifies system vulnerabilities,â€?Huckabee Sanders said. She said the report would be complete by 2018. The new panel coincides with several U.S. investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the November election, including selectively leaking hacked emails and circulating false news reports. Russian officials have denied such interference. ",politicsNews,2017/5/11,1

0378,California governor proposes more money to fight Trump,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California governor Jerry Brown on Thursday proposed a funding increase for the state attorney general to create more than 30 new positions dedicated to combating President Donald Trumpâ€™s policies.  Democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of the Republican presidentâ€™s agenda. State attorneys general in Washington and Hawaii successfully sued to block Trumpâ€™s executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and California attorney general Xavier Becerra has pledged to defend the stateâ€™s environmental standards and health care access. Brown has been particularly outspoken against Trumpâ€™s policies. In budget revisions released on Thursday, Brownâ€™s office proposed a $6.5 million increase for Californiaâ€™s Department of Justice, enough to fund 31 positions to address â€œvarious actions taken at the federal level that impact public safety, healthcare, the environment, consumer affairs and general constitutional issues.â€?The department has expended over 11,000 hours of legal work in response to federal issues since Trumpâ€™s inauguration in January, according the governorâ€™s office.  Brownâ€™s proposals would have to be approved by Californiaâ€™s legislature, which is dominated by Democrats. At a press conference, Brown repeatedly expressed the need to fight the Trump administration on health care reforms under discussion in Washington. The potential loss of funds for the stateâ€™s Medicaid program alone would be enough to fund the University of California system for a year, Brown said. Given that backdrop, Brown said Becerra deserves â€œsome latitudeâ€?in pursuing litigation.  A spokeswoman for Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment. Brownâ€™s budget also proposed a $15 million increase to expand legal services for immigrants seeking assistance securing legal status in the United States and fighting deportation.

0384,Comey had pushed for more resources for Russia probe before being fired by Trump: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey, days before President Donald Trump fired him, told lawmakers he sought more resources for his agencyâ€™s probe into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 U.S. election, a congressional source said on Wednesday. With the Republican president facing a storm of criticism from many Democratic lawmakers and some in his own party, the Trump administration accused Comey of â€œatrocitiesâ€?on the job and denied his firing was related to the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation. Trump, who met Russiaâ€™s foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, lashed out at critics, calling Democrats â€œphony hypocrites,â€?and defended his decision to abruptly oust Comey on Tuesday from the law enforcement post he held since 2013. In a farewell letter to staff seen by CNN, Comey, who was appointed by Trumpâ€™s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had â€œlong believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all.â€?Comey added he would not spend time dwelling on Trumpâ€™s decision â€œor the way it was executed.â€?But Democrats ramped up accusations that Comeyâ€™s removal was intended to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and demanded an independent investigation into the alleged Russian meddling, with some calling the firing an attempt to cover up wrongdoing related to Russia. A congressional source with knowledge of the matter said Comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the Justice Department to make additional resources available - mainly more staffing - for the Russia probe. Comey informed lawmakers of that request after the Senate Intelligence Committee, conducting its own investigation, had asked the FBI to speed up its Russia inquiry, the source said. Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committeeâ€™s top Democrat, told reporters she understood Comey was seeking more resources for the FBI investigation. Responding to media reports that Comey had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agencyâ€™s probe, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email: â€œTotally false.â€?U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia has denied any such meddling. The Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Top U.S. Republicans rallied to Trumpâ€™s defense, but some called the action troubling. Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said in a statement on Wednesday he had requested a review by the Department of Justiceâ€™s inspector general of Trumpâ€™s decision to fire Comey, who had more than six years left in his 10-year post. Comeyâ€™s dismissal stunned Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaignâ€™s alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency, while also threatening to hinder his policy goals. â€œHe wasnâ€™t doing a good job, very simply,â€?the Republican president said of Comey during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the White House Oval Office. The administration said on Tuesday that Comeyâ€™s firing stemmed from his handling of an election-year FBI probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. White House officials said Trumpâ€™s anger at Comey had been building for months but a turning point came when the FBI chief refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a May 3 Senate hearing on the Clinton email issue, an act Trump and his aides took it as an act of insubordination. Trump had been considering letting Comey go â€œsince the day he was electedâ€?in November, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She referred to what she called Comeyâ€™s â€œatrocities in circumventing the chain of commandâ€?at the Justice Department. Many Democrats have criticized Comeyâ€™s management of the Clinton investigation, but they questioned the timing of his dismissal, given that Trump could have acted soon after taking office on Jan. 20 and that he has repeatedly criticized the FBI and congressional probes into Russiaâ€™s role in the election. In a flurry of Twitter posts, Trump said Comey had â€œlost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.â€?He added, â€œDems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!â€?The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor. Schumer called on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold closed and potentially classified briefings with all senators to question the top Justice Department officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein. â€œWe know Director Comey was leading an investigation (into) whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president?â€?Schumer said. McConnell accused Democrats of â€œcomplaining about the removal of an FBI director who they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticizedâ€?and said a special prosecutor would impede existing probes like one under way in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Paul Ryan, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, told Fox News in an interview it was â€œentirely within the presidentâ€™s role and authorityâ€?to remove Comey and that a special prosecutor was unnecessary. Mark Warner, the intelligence committeeâ€™s top Democrat, said he and the panelâ€™s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, had asked Comey to testify before the panel in private next Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, the intelligence panel said it had issued a subpoena requesting documents from Trumpâ€™s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in relation to its Russia probe. The committee said it had first requested the documents in a letter to Flynn on April 28. Flynn was forced to resign in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Trump said he had â€œa very, very good meetingâ€?with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and they discussed Syriaâ€™s civil war. Their meeting was the highest-level public contact between Trump and Putinâ€™s government since Trump took office.  During an earlier appearance at the State Department, Lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when asked about Comeyâ€™s dismissal, saying: â€œWas he fired? Youâ€™re kidding. Youâ€™re kidding.â€?In the Russian city of Sochi, Putin said Comeyâ€™s firing would not have an impact on U.S.-Russian relations. Trumpâ€™s nominee as the new FBI director would need to win Senate confirmation. Trumpâ€™s possible choices to head the FBI on an interim basis, according to a White House official, include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Assistant Director Paul Abbate, Chicago FBI agent Michael Anderson and Richmond, Virginia, agent Adam Lee.

0388,Comey infuriated Trump with refusal to preview Senate testimony: aides," (This story corrects reference to Russian ambassador in paragraph 10.) By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The anger behind Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday had been building for months, but a turning point came when Comey refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a Senate panel, White House officials said. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say at a May 3 hearing about his handling of an investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server. When Comey refused, Trump and his aides considered that an act of insubordination and it was one of the catalysts to Trumpâ€™s decision this week to fire the FBI director, the officials said.  â€œIt gave the impression that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties,â€?one official said. Previews of congressional testimony to superiors are generally considered courteous. Comey, who testified for four hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him feel â€œmildly nauseousâ€?that his decision to make public his reopening of a probe into Clintonâ€™s handling of classified information might have affected the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election. But he said he had no regrets and would make the same decision again. Trumpâ€™s sudden firing of Comey shocked Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaignâ€™s alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. Democrats accused the Republican president of firing Comey to try to undermine the FBIâ€™s probe into Russiaâ€™s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 election and possible collusion with members of the Trump campaign, and demanded an independent investigation. Some of Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans called his dismissal of Comey troubling.  The Trump administration said on Tuesday Comey was fired because of his handling of the Clinton email probe. Before he axed Comey, Trump had publicly expressed frustration with the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. A former Trump adviser said Trump was also angry because Comey had never offered a public exoneration of Trump in the FBI probe into contacts between the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, and Trump campaign advisers last year. According to this former adviser, Comeyâ€™s Senate testimony on the Clinton emails likely reinforced in Trumpâ€™s mind that â€œComey was against him.â€? â€œHe regretted what he did to Hillary but not what he did to Trump,â€?the former Trump adviser said of Comey. Clinton has said that the Comey decision to announce the renewed inquiry days before the election was a likely factor in her loss to Trump. Aides said Trump moved quickly after receiving a recommendation on Monday to terminate Comey from Rosenstein, who began reviewing the situation at the FBI shortly after taking office two weeks ago. Trumpâ€™s move was so sudden that his White House staff, accustomed to his impromptu style, was caught off guard. Stunned aides scrambled to put together a plan to explain what happened. White House spokesman Sean Spicer ended up briefing reporters about the move in the dark on Tuesday night near a patch of bushes steps away from the West Wing. Comey, who was in Los Angeles meeting with FBI employees on Tuesday and returned later to Washington, has made no public comment on his firing. Many questions remained about what caused Trump to move so quickly. Two former senior Justice Department officials said it made little sense to fire Comey while the Justice Department Inspector General was still doing a review of the FBIâ€™s handling of the Clinton email investigation. â€œI take Rod (Rosenstein) at his word that be believed everything in that memo but he must know that itâ€™s going to be used as a fig leaf to fire Comey,â€?one former official said.  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters it was her â€œunderstandingâ€?Comey had been seeking more resources for his investigation into the tangled Russia controversy. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had pondered dumping Comey as soon as he took office on Jan. 20, but decided to stick with him. Trump shrugged off the political firestorm he created with Comeyâ€™s dismissal as he met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Asked by reporters why he fired Comey, Trump said, â€œHe wasnâ€™t doing a good job, very simply. He wasnâ€™t doing a good job.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1

0391,"Delay seen, again, on Trump growth agenda after Comey sacking","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Not even a week after the Trump administration and Congress rekindled optimism that they could soon make progress on a pro-growth agenda including tax cuts, the unexpected firing of the head of the FBI late Tuesday presented investors with a fresh reason to second-guess their confidence in the â€œTrump trade.â€?At the least, financial market participants viewed President Donald Trumpâ€™s abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as an unwelcome distraction, while some fretted it could tie Washington in knots for months, potentially postponing already-delayed reforms. The takeaway for the stock markets: donâ€™t bet on any quick legislation around trade, the budget, healthcare or infrastructure. â€œThere is nothing good out of this for markets,â€?said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. â€œIt will weigh on Trumpâ€™s ability to cut deals with Congress. It costs him negotiating leverage.â€Â?Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Private Bank, said, â€œon a medium-term basis, it does undermine the administrationâ€™s power to get things done.â€? Trump's election last November unleashed a powerful upswing in U.S. stock markets on the premise that he would cut taxes and regulation and usher through a major infrastructure spending package. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX has gained 12 percent since Election Day, while shares of tech stocks and smaller companies have performed even better.  Nagging concerns about Trumpâ€™s ability to get things done, along with some anxiety about stretched equity valuations, have combined to cap the rally, and stocks have done little since early March. Around midday Wednesday, the S&P was near unchanged, as were other market benchmarks. The administration recovered some credibility last week when the House of Representatives voted to repeal major portions of former President Barack Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act after failing to do so a month earlier. The simple achievement of advancing the healthcare bill to the Senate had been seen by investors as a signal that enacting tax cuts was doable, the big question was just how soon - this year or next.  â€œThereâ€™s a tremendous amount of hope baked into the market that Trump is going to be able to act, particularly on tax reform,â€?said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. Edward Perkin, Chief Equity Investment Officer at Eaton Vance, said if the date to pass tax â€œis pushed out itâ€™s not so much a problem, but if people question if it will ever happen, then thatâ€™s a problem.â€?The degree to which this further alienates Democrats on Capitol Hill, especially in the Senate, was another concern given how narrow support has been so far for Trumpâ€™s agenda. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democratic lawmaker from California, was not optimistic that tensions between the parties would ease anytime soon. â€œI had been hopeful that we could have a line of activity thatâ€™s going to bring a very divided country together,â€?Feinstein told Reuters Wednesday. â€œThe problem out there is that people are so divided.â€?Should the Comey episode weaken Trumpâ€™s bargaining ability with lawmakers, it may actually act as a catalyst for a tax bill, just one that might resemble congressional Republicansâ€?version more than Trumpâ€™s. â€œAn ongoing special investigation or shift in the balance of power could actually make Trump more eager to sign offâ€?on the previously existing congressional tax plan, analysts at NatWest Markets said. Of course, some had already adopted the view that Trumpâ€™s promised reforms were a distant hope, at best. â€œInvestors are realizing that the fiscal policy agenda is being pushed out farther on the horizon,â€?Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors (STT.N).

In a joint statement, Senators Richard Burr, the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, said the committee had first requested the documents from Flynn in a April 28 letter, but the retired lieutenant general had declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committeeâ€™s request. It was the first subpoena announced by the committee in its investigation. Warner said on Tuesday that the committee has been receiving documents as it investigates allegations that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election, something Moscow denies. But he told Reuters that some people were not complying â€œso we were going to take next steps.â€?The Trump administration denies any collusion with Russia. Flynn has been a focus of investigations into Russia and the election. He was forced to resign in February as Trumpâ€™s national security adviser for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergey Kislyak, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates testified at a high-profile hearing on Monday that she had warned the White House in January that Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. The subpoena was announced a day after Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the bureauâ€™s investigation of Russia and the election. Comeyâ€™s firing prompted a storm of criticism from Democrats, who accused the president of seeking to stall the probe.

0395,Bid to revoke Obama methane rule fails in surprise U.S. Senate vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a resolution to revoke an Obama-era rule to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands, dealing a blow to President Donald Trumpâ€™s efforts to free the drilling industry from what he sees as excessive environmental regulation. The Congressional Review Act resolution received just 49 votes after Republican leaders scrambled for weeks to secure the 51 needed to pass it. The resolution would have revoked the rule and prevented similar regulations from being introduced. Getting the Trump administration to repeal the BLM rule had been a top priority of the oil and gas industry. Companies said it was unnecessary, would could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well and hinder production. But not all Republicans supported the measure, in part because it would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.  Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona made a surprise vote against the resolution, joining fellow Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine in opposition to torpedo it. â€œWhile I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is â€˜similarâ€?â€?McCain said in a statement. He said the Interior Department should issue a new rule on to replace the existing one on methane leaks, which he called a public health and air quality issue. The rule, finalized by President Barack Obama in his last weeks in office, updated 30-year-old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production. Obamaâ€™s administration said it would preserve up to 41 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas per year that is currently lost to leaks and flaring. The American Petroleum Institute and other industry groups have said the methane rule is unnecessary because companies have made strides in reducing leaks on their own.  â€œThe rule could impede U.S. energy production while reducing local and federal revenues,â€?said Erik Milito, APIâ€™s Upstream and Industry Operations Group Director. Members of the Western Energy Alliance, which include Devon Energy , Whiting Petroleum and EOG Resources  had also been strongly opposed to the rule. Environmental groups hailed what they depicted as a rare victory for the environment after several regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration. â€œIn recent months, thousands of Americans asked the Senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today,â€?said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society. The Western Values Project estimated that if the rule had been rescinded, the U.S. Treasury would have lost out on $800 million in lost potential royalties from leaked or vented natural gas over the next decade. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works who supported the resolution to kill the rule, called on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to act unilaterally to revoke it.

0396,Trump meets Russia foreign minister amid Comey controversy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s top diplomat met President Donald Trump on Wednesday and praised the U.S. administration as problem solvers, just as the White House drew criticism over the firing of the FBI director who was leading a probe into Moscowâ€™s alleged interference in U.S. politics.  The talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were the highest-level public contact between Trump and the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Republican took office on Jan. 20.  While not unprecedented, it is a rare privilege for a foreign minister to be received by a U.S. president for a bilateral meeting in the White House. In a stunning development, Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey, whose agency is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the possibility Trump associates may have colluded with Moscow. Democrats accused Trump of trying to slow down the investigation by firing the FBI chief. Trump described his talks with Lavrov as â€œvery, very good.â€?When asked whether the Comey dismissal had affected his meeting, Trump said, â€œnot at all.â€?He and Lavrov said they discussed the civil war in Syria, where Russia backs President Bashar al-Assad. â€œWe want to see the killing, the horrible killing, stopped in Syria as soon as possible and everyone is working toward that end,â€?Trump told reporters. Lavrov, who earlier met with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said his discussions with members of the Trump administration had convinced him they were people who wanted to cut deals and solve problems. â€œThe Trump administration, and the president himself, and the secretary of state, I was persuaded of this once again today, are people of action,â€?Lavrov said. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia denies the allegations. Blaming â€œfake information,â€?Lavrov said: â€œI believe that politicians are damaging the political system of the U.S., trying to pretend that someone is controlling America from the outside.â€? The Trump administration denies claims of collusion with Russia. Earlier, as Tillerson and Lavrov posed for photographs, the Russian sarcastically deflected a reporterâ€™s question about Comeyâ€™s dismissal. Asked if the firing would cast a shadow over his talks, Lavrov replied: â€œWas he fired? Youâ€™re kidding. Youâ€™re kidding.â€?             The Russian embassy in Washington tweeted a picture from the Lavrov meeting of Trump shaking hands with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a man at the center of the controversy on Russian contacts with associates of Trump. Former U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Senior Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said the Oval Office encounter was a photo opportunity for Russia. â€œPresident Trump in these pictures, is shaking hands with Russians, and the Kremlin is gleefully tweeting these pictures around the world,â€?Durbin said on the Senate floor. Wednesdayâ€™s meetings followed talks Tillerson held with Putin last month in Moscow. Tensions in the relationship grew following U.S. air strikes against a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on Assad.  Both Trump and Lavrov appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone after both capitals had presented souring views of the relationship recently. The White House said Trump â€œraised the possibility of broader cooperation on resolving conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhereâ€?and still sought to build a better relationship between the two countries. Lavrov said that despite difficulties â€œour countries can and should contribute jointly to the settlement of the most urgent issues in international affairsâ€?     Trump underscored â€œthe need for Russia to rein in the Assad regime, Iran and Iranian proxies,â€?the White House said. Lavrov said the meeting mainly focused on ideas of de-escalation zones in Syria. Russia brokered a deal for de-escalation zones with backing from Iran and Syrian opposition supporter Turkey during ceasefire talks in the Kazakh capital Astana last week. ",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1
0397,Trump U.S. antitrust nominee says will be independent of White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator, said on Wednesday that he would maintain independence from the White House in enforcing antitrust law. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim. In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trumpâ€™s firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna. Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. Obamaâ€™s Justice Department sued to stop the deal, and the case is currently under appeal. Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division, Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement. â€œThe independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence,â€?he said. â€œThey will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed.â€?Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president. If confirmed as expected, Delrahimâ€™s antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. Former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a â€œmerger tsunamiâ€?and blocked many of them. Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahimâ€™s career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general for antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pateâ€™s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Departmentâ€™s assessment of AT&Tâ€™s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.  The department is reviewing major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChinaâ€™s purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three. ",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1
0398,Factbox: The future of FBI's Russia probe after Comey firing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s dismissal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey has raised questions about the future of the agencyâ€™s probe into Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. Democrats are worried Comeyâ€™s firing on Tuesday could jeopardize the ongoing FBI probe and have renewed calls for an independent investigation. Some Republicans have said that could undermine concurrent investigations underway in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Here is what could happen next: * The investigations already underway could continue. Comeyâ€™s firing does not necessarily mean the FBIâ€™s investigation into Moscowâ€™s role in the 2016 election will be disrupted or end, legal experts told Reuters. The career FBI staffers Comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it, even as the search for a new director begins. The parallel inquiries underway in Senate and House committees could likewise progress. * The Justice Department, other federal agencies or the U.S. Congress could conduct independent investigations. The Justice Department could conduct a criminal investigation. But other federal agencies and departments have the power to conduct fact-finding inquiries, according to University of Southern California law professor Sam Erman. Congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes, Erman said. * The Justice Department could appoint a special counsel. Most Democrats have said they prefer the appointment of a special counsel at the Justice Department to oversee the probe since it is the only agency that can bring a criminal case. A law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor lapsed in the 1990s but department regulations provide that the attorney general can appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government. If the attorney general ignores the recommendations of a special counsel, the rules specify that a report must be sent to Congress, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. The attorney general can hire staff to do the job of a special counsel without triggering department rules. This occurred in 2003 when a special counsel investigated the disclosure of the identity of intelligence officer Valerie Plame. * Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from involvement in Russia-related probes after misstating his own contacts in 2016 with Russiaâ€™s ambassador in Washington. Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Some Democrats, however, have already raised questions about Sessionsâ€?role in advising Rosenstein on Comeyâ€™s firing and called for a nonpolitical appointee at the Justice Department to make the special counsel decision. * The appointment of a special counsel would not end the congressional probes. Senate Republicans, including some from leadership, have said a special counsel should not be appointed because it would imperil ongoing congressional probes but a special counsel would not have the authority to demand Congress halt a probe. Criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, particularly with witness testimony. But an investigation undertaken by a special counsel would be no different than the one already underway at the FBI. â€œIt wouldnâ€™t interfere any more or any less if a special counsel were appointed,â€?Levitt said.

0402,Four U.S. states sue Interior Department over coal leases on public lands,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four U.S. states have sued Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the Interior Department and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to block new leases of public lands for coal mining, according to papers filed on Tuesday in Montana federal court. State prosecutors for California, New Mexico, New York and Washington are arguing new coal extraction would exacerbate global warming and violate the federal governmentâ€™s statutory duty to use public lands â€œin a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archaeological values,â€?according to the filings. The move was one of several recent attempts to block a broad pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump to roll back environmental regulations put in place under former President Barack Obama. The former president placed a moratorium on new coal mining leases on public lands more than a year ago, in January 2016.  On March 29, Zinke, whom Trump appointed Interior secretary, formally lifted the ban. The prosecutors argued in addition to harming the environment, more coal mining on public lands would burden state and local governments with expenses related to healthcare, flood control and other infrastructure needs related to potentially harmful effects of nearby mines.  They also argued the United Statesâ€?â€œoutdated structureâ€?for collecting royalties from mining companies meant the government was not obtaining as much money for the leases as it deserved. A spokesman for the Interior Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is State of New Mexico et al v.

In a news conference at a waterfront park near his childhood home, an emotional Murray denied the claims against him, which he has called politically motivated, according to a video posted on the mayorâ€™s Facebook page. Murray, a Democrat and the cityâ€™s first openly gay mayor, also suggested that the accusations were rooted in stereotypes of gay men. â€œThe mayorâ€™s race must be focused on... issues, not on a scandal, which it would be focused on if I were to remain in this race,â€?Murray, who became mayor in 2014, said in announcing his withdrawal from the race. As a senator in the Washington state legislature, Murray championed gay rights and legalizing same-sex marriage. During his term as mayor, Seattle sued President Donald Trump over his executive order cracking down on sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.     A primary election for mayor will take place Aug. 1 and the two candidates with the most votes will face off in the Nov. 7 general election.     In April, a 46-year-old man sued Murray, claiming that the mayor paid him for sex when he was a homeless, drug-addicted teenager in the 1980s, according to the lawsuit.     The Seattle Times newspaper said that in 2008 two other men had accused Murray of abusing them when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Murray has denied those claims, which did not become public until last month. A fourth accuser in a sworn court declaration made similar allegations against Murray, according to the Seattle Times. Murray consistently denied the claims, calling the accusations politically motivated, but also garnered criticism for questioning the trustworthiness of the accusers, which the Seattle Times said had criminal records.

0411,"Trump fires FBI Director Comey, setting off U.S. political storm"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a political firestorm on Tuesday by firing FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaignâ€™s possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome.  READ THE LATEST ON THE COMEY FIRINGDefending firing of FBI director, Trump derides Democratic criticsSenate Republican leader opposed new Russia investigationThe Republican president said he fired Comey, the top U.S. law enforcement official, over his handling of an election-year email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  The move stunned Washington and raised suspicions among Democrats and others that the White House was trying to blunt the FBI probe involving Russia.  Some Democrats compared Trumpâ€™s move to the â€œSaturday Night Massacreâ€?of 1973, in which President Richard Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.  White House officials denied allegations that there was any political motive in the move by Trump, who took office on Jan. 20.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he spoke to Trump and told him he was â€œmaking a very big mistakeâ€?in firing Comey, adding the president did not â€œreally answerâ€?in response.  An independent investigation into Moscowâ€™s role in the election â€œis now the only way to go to restore the American peopleâ€™s faith,â€?Schumer said.  Though many Democrats have criticized Comeyâ€™s handling of the Clinton email probe, they said they were troubled by the timing of Trumpâ€™s firing of him.  Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is overseeing its own investigation into Russian interference during the election, said in a statement he was also troubled by the timing of Comeyâ€™s termination.  â€œHis dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation,â€?Burr said.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election, with the aim of helping Trump.  CNN reported on Tuesday night that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, seeking business records, as part of the probe into Russian interference in the election.  Trumpâ€™s firing of Comey came a day after former acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a Senate panel that she had informed the White House on Jan. 26 that Flynn was at risk of blackmail by Moscow because he had been untruthful about his discussions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. Trump fired Flynn 18 days later.  Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.  Trump, in a letter to Comey released by the White House, said: â€œIt is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.â€? The president told Comey in the letter that he accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he could no longer provide effective leadership. Comeyâ€™s term was to run through September 2023. He was appointed director by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.  Sessions advised Trumpâ€™s campaign before being picked by the president to lead the Justice Department. Sessions had recused himself from involvement in the Russia investigation, after he misstated his own 2016 contacts with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington.  Comeyâ€™s deputy, Andrew McCabe, became acting FBI director. The White House said the search for a new permanent director would begin immediately.  Pushing back against critics of the move, White House officials said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career prosecutor who took office on April 25, assessed the situation at the FBI and concluded that Comey had lost his confidence.  Rosenstein sent his recommendation to Sessions, who concurred and they forwarded their recommendation to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday, they said.  The White House released a memo in which Rosenstein wrote: â€œI cannot defend the Directorâ€™s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintonâ€™s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.â€? Rosenstein cited several former Justice Department officialsâ€?comments criticizing Comeyâ€™s handling of the Clinton email investigation, including his public statements.  But one of those he cited, Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under President H.W. Bush, questioned the purported reasons for the firing. Reached by Reuters, Ayer said in an email that the administrationâ€™s explanation was â€œa sham.â€? Comey was traveling in Los Angeles when the news broke that he had been fired.  In an odd twist, a White House official said the letter firing him was delivered to the FBI by Keith Schiller, Trumpâ€™s longtime armed personal bodyguard who is now director of Oval Office Operations at the White House.  Trump, in the letter, said: â€œWhile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau.â€? Comey, 56, had been the target of criticism from many quarters for his handling of a probe involving Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state under Obama. As recently as Tuesday, the FBI clarified remarks that Comey made on the matter last week.  Trump had originally criticized the FBI director for not pursuing criminal charges against Clinton last July, but later lavished praise on him.  Comey had said in July the Clinton email case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before the Nov. 8 election - that he had reopened the investigation because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.  Clinton and other Democrats say they believe Comeyâ€™s decision help cost her the election.  The firing came as a shock to FBI staff, nearly all of whom had confidence in Comey despite the controversy surrounding his handling of the Clinton email situation, according to an FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The official said there was concern among agents that the firing was a political act related to the Russian investigation.  Other current and former U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials questioned the White House explanation for Comeyâ€™s firing.  â€œTrump praised him for the work on the email investigation, so thatâ€™s not it,â€?said Austin Berglas, a former FBI supervisory agent on hacking cases. â€œI think he realized the extent of the Russia investigation under way and moved him out. To me, thatâ€™s the only logical explanation right now.â€? Trumpâ€™s dismissal of Comey does not mean the FBIâ€™s investigation into Russiaâ€™s interference in the U.S. presidential election will be disrupted or end - career FBI staffers can continue the probe even as the search for a new FBI director begins, legal experts said.  Republican Representative Justin Amash wrote on Twitter that he and his staff were reviewing the possibility of drafting legislation to create an independent commission to look into the Russian campaign meddling.  Legislation related to the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent counsel has lapsed. But Justice Department regulations provide for the appointment of a special counsel, which is selected by the attorney general, or acting attorney general in the case of recusal, the experts said.

0413,Timeline: FBI Director Comey's year of controversy ends in firing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of FBI Director James Comey followed a turbulent year for Comey in which he became embroiled in controversy over his handling of investigations involving both Trump and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Here is a timeline of the events that preceded Comeyâ€™s firing and Trumpâ€™s reaction to them. Comey announced he had recommended no criminal charges filed against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state but called her â€œextremely carelessâ€?for using a private email server. Trump responded to the news by tweeting that Comeyâ€™s decision was an example of a â€œrigged systemâ€?in the United States. â€œVery very unfair! As usual, bad judgment,â€?he tweeted. Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election, Comey announced in a letter to Congress that the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appeared to pertain to the Clinton investigation and they would be reviewed whether they contained classified information.  The abrupt decision to renew the investigation upset Democrats who believed the announcement would have an impact on voting trends on Election Day and harm Clintonâ€™s chances of victory. Campaigning in Michigan, Trump exulted at the news of a reopened probe into actions surrounding an opponent he had dubbed â€œCrooked Hillary.â€?â€œThat was so bad what happened originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had where theyâ€™re trying to protect her from criminal prosecution,â€?Trump said. Two days after his inauguration, Trump was at an event in the White House and saw Comey in the audience. He called out to him and Comey strode up and they warmly shook hands and briefly embraced.   â€œHeâ€™s become more famous than me,â€?Trump said with a chuckle. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after only 24 days in office after it was disclosed that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Comey, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, said the FBI had been investigating possible coordination between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Clinton told a Women for Women event in New York that the Comey announcement threw the election for Trump. â€œIf the election had been onÂ Oct. 27, I would be your president,â€?she said. Trump responded with a late-night series of tweets. â€œFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!â€?Trump tweeted. White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about Trumpâ€™s tweet about Comey. â€œThe president has confidence in the director,â€?Spicer told reporters. May 4, 2017 Comey, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him â€œmildly nauseousâ€?to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into Clintonâ€™s emails affected the 2016 presidential election, but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again.  In four hours of testimony Comey gave an impassioned defense of his decision to reopen the Clinton probe. May 8, 2017 ProPublica reported possible inaccuracies about Comeyâ€™s statements about Clinton aide Huma Abedin. It said the FBI was said to be preparing to correct the record but that the plan appeared to be on hold with the bureau undecided about what to do. MIDAFTERNOON, May 9, 2017 At his afternoon daily briefing White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked whether Trump still had confidence in Comey. Unlike his statement from a week earlier when he said Trump had confidence in Comey, Spicer equivocated. â€œI donâ€™t want to start speaking on behalf of the president without speaking to him first,â€?Spicer said. ABOUT 5:30 PM, May 9, 2017 In a brief appearance in the White House press room, Spicer announced Trump had accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Comey. A letter provided to the news media from Rosenstein cited Comeyâ€™s handling of the Clinton probe. The New York Times reported Comey got the news while in Los Angeles where he had been addressing FBI employees there. When a TV in the background flashed the news, Comey at first thought it was a prank, but then got word he had been fired. At the FBI headquarters in Washington, Trump personal aide Keith Schiller was seen leaving the building. A White House official said he had delivered Trumpâ€™s letter announcing Comeyâ€™s dismissal.

0414,The firing line: Ouster of FBI's Comey tests new Justice appointee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The newly appointed second-in-command at the U.S. Justice Department faced a weighty task just two weeks after taking office - writing the rationale for firing FBI Director James Comey. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued the case for Comeyâ€™s sacking in a three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday. President Donald Trump acted swiftly to dismiss the director later that day. Rosenstein cited Comeyâ€™s controversial public statements about the bureauâ€™s investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. â€œIt is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do,â€?Rosenstein wrote of Comeyâ€™s public comments. Spokespeople for the Department of Justice and the FBI did not return calls seeking comment late Tuesday. Comeyâ€™s firing will likely be seen as further evidence of Washingtonâ€™s hyper-partisan upheaval. Rosenstein has drawn fire from Democrats who allege political motives in the White House decision to dismiss Comey - and particularly, its timing. â€œWhy did it happen today?â€?asked Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. â€œWe know the FBI has been looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians ... Were those investigations getting too close to home for the President?â€?The rationale for canning Comey, however, came from a 26-year Justice Department veteran who is widely viewed by his peers and many lawmakers as uncommonly nonpartisan. Named as Marylandâ€™s top prosecutor by President George W. Bush, Rosenstein stayed in office through the Obama administration.  Rosenstein was the longest-serving U.S. attorney when he was nominated by Trump last January. When he was confirmed by the Senate, he enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support - a 94-to-6 vote - despite the deeply divided culture of todayâ€™s Washington. Bonnie Greenberg, a federal prosecutor in Maryland told Reuters in March that Rosenstein was admired as a rare career prosecutor who could insulate himself from political pressure. â€œHe only does something if he thinks itâ€™s right,â€?said Greenberg, who worked with Rosenstein for 11 years.  Many in the Justice Department saw Rosensteinâ€™s appointment as a counter-balance to the extreme partisanship surrounding accusations of Russian interference in last yearâ€™s election. And he was immediately swept into that fray.  Before Rosenstein was confirmed for the position by the U.S. Senate, some Democratic lawmakers asked him to pledge he would appoint a special independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  He was easily confirmed despite rebuffing those demands. Some Republicans have been angered by Comeyâ€™s public statements about the FBI investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.  But Rosensteinâ€™s criticism of Comey focused on actions seen to have damaged Democratic candidate Clinton. Rosenstein focused in particular on Comeyâ€™s news conference last July, when the director announced his conclusion that Clinton should not be prosecuted - while at the same time publicly bashing her use of a private email server for sensitive U.S. government business. That day, Rosenstein wrote, Comey usurped the authority of the U.S. Attorney General - who has authority over whether prosecutions should proceed, based on the quality of FBI investigations. Comey also violated longstanding practice by â€œgratuitouslyâ€?releasing damaging information about Clinton - even as he acknowledged the evidence against her was insufficient to warrant continued investigation, Rosenstein wrote. â€œWe do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,â€?Rosenstein wrote, adding that Comey â€œlaid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial.â€? U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the timing of Comeyâ€™s firing was suspect - coming so long after the election of Trump and Comeyâ€™s alleged mishandling of the case. He directly criticized Rosenstein.  â€œI am very disappointed with this deputy attorney general, who I was told had a good reputation,â€?he said. â€œBut signing this letter saying that he recommends firing Comey because of Comeyâ€™s actions with Hillary Clinton nine months ago, or 10 months ago? That doesnâ€™t pass any smell test.â€?Rosenstein, in his letter, cited broad, bipartisan agreement on Comeyâ€™s errors in judgment. Last summer, Comey defended his decision to speak publicly about the Clinton investigation, saying â€œthe American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.â€?Last week, before a Senate committee, Comey defended his decision in October - two weeks before the presidential election - to publicly announce the bureau had discovered new emails that might be related to the closed investigation into Clinton. â€œTo not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view,â€?Comey said. Rosenstein wrote that he was perplexed at Comeyâ€™s continued defenses of his handling of the probe. â€œI do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,â€?Rosenstein wrote. â€œIt is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1
0415,"FBI in turmoil over Comey firing, scramble on for new chief","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI was reeling after President Donald Trump unexpectedly fired its director James Comey, with agency staff scheduling an emergency high-level meeting for Tuesday night amid speculation about who would replace Comey in the top job. An FBI official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters and so asked not to be identified, said the staff meeting would explore next steps for the law-enforcement agency. Trump sacked Comey amidst a probe into the Trump 2016 presidential campaignâ€™s possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome, sparking backlash from some Democrats in Congress who said the decision had the appearance of a cover-up and some Republicans who called the timing troubling.  The official said the FBI had no idea the Trump administration was considering dismissing Comey and the news â€œtook even top officials by surprise.â€?An FBI spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was expected to step in for now, but he was unlikely to be nominated by Trump for the directorâ€™s post, said two former FBI officials. Comey, who was appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, had 6-1/2 years left in his term as director of  an agency with 56 U.S. field offices and more than 30,000 employees.  The new director must be appointed by Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.      Comey is the third high-profile law-enforcement official to be fired under Trump. Preet Bharara was fired as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and Sally Yates was fired as acting attorney general. Trump, a Republican businessman and former TV celebrity, was elected on Nov. 8 and took office on Jan. 20. One possible contender for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is Dana Boente, No. 3 at the Justice Department and former acting attorney general, said the two former FBI officials. Other potential choices include Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, a former prosecutor who led a congressional inquiry into former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s role in the 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Close campaign allies of Trump include former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Sheriff David Clarke. But both men would be seen as highly political nominees for an agency designed to be independent. â€œThe White House has to avoid all the politicos if they are going to get a nominee through the Senate,â€?said one of the former FBI officials.   Boente was tapped to temporarily lead the Justice Departmentâ€™s Trump-Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Trump appointee, stepped down because of his dealings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Rod Rosenstein replaced Boente in that role when the Senate confirmed him as deputy attorney general last month. Rosenstein served as a federal prosecutor under both Republican President George W. Bush and Obama. A lengthy memo from Rosenstein on Tuesday faulted Comey for his handling of an FBI probe of Clintonâ€™s private email server. ",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1
0416,Flynn associates subpoenaed in Russia probe: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn when he was a private citizen, CNN reported on Tuesday. Citing people familiar with the matter, CNN said the subpoenas were issued by the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office in Alexandria, Virginia. They targeted people who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was pushed out of his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, it reported. Flynn later joined the Trump campaign but was fired as the White House national security adviser by President Donald Trump in February after he failed to tell the truth about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynnâ€™s attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department does not comment on the existence of ongoing investigations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into allegations Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump, as well as possible links to the Trump campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, saying he had lost confidence in Comey over his handling of an election-year email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn, a retired general, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes.  Investigators have been looking into whether Flynn properly disclosed payments from clients with links to foreign governments, including Russia and Turkey, CNN said.     ",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1
0417,"Trump firing of FBI Director Comey evokes criticism, praise","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After U.S. President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress denounced the move and renewed calls for an independent investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Democrats likened the dismissal to President Richard Nixonâ€™s firing of an independent special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation and discounted Trumpâ€™s contention that the move was related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the emails of Hillary Clinton, Trumpâ€™s rival for the presidency. Some Republicans defended the firing, saying new leadership was needed at the law enforcement agency. Here are reactions from Democrats and Republicans to Comeyâ€™s firing: â€œNo one should accept President Trumpâ€™s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly. ... This is nothing less than Nixonian.â€?- Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy  â€œTodayâ€™s action by President Trump completely obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis.â€?- Democratic Representative John Conyers  â€œGiven the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well.â€?- Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  â€œThis is Nixonian. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the Trump/Russia investigation.â€?-Democratic Senator Bob Casey  â€œI am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comeyâ€™s termination ... His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.â€?- Republican Senator Richard Burr, head of the Senate committee investigating Russia role in the election â€œThe decision ... raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter ... The same president who has called the investigation into the Russian hacking of our democracy and the potential complicity of his campaign a â€˜fake,â€?cannot pretend to have made such a decision uninfluenced by his concerns over Comeyâ€™s continued involvement in the investigation.â€?- Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee looking into possible Russian connections â€œAny suggestion that todayâ€™s announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBIâ€™s investigation of Russiaâ€™s attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced. The president did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.â€?- Republican Senator Susan Collins â€œEarlier this afternoon, President Trump called me and informed me he was firing Director Comey. I told the president: â€˜Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistakeâ€?... Given the way the president has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration.â€?- Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in remarks to reporters â€œThere is now a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department and President Trump is not being held accountable because House Republicans refuse to work with us to do our job.â€?- Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, who called for immediate emergency hearings â€œMany, including myself, have questioned his actions more than once over the past year. I believe new leadership at the FBI will restore confidence in the organization and among the people who do the hard work to carry out its mission.â€?- Republican Senator Roy Blunt in a statement â€œThe presidentâ€™s actions today are shocking. ... The only way this administration can begin to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law ... is to cooperate fully with the ongoing congressional investigations and to support the appointment of an independent special counsel.â€?- Democratic Senator Mark Warner  â€œThis FBI director has sought for years to jail me on account of my political activities. If I can oppose his firing, so can you.â€?- Fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked intelligence documents and is now living in Russia, on Twitter â€œOver the course of the last several months, Director Comeyâ€™s decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.â€?- Republican Senator Charles Grassley  â€œThere can be no question that a fully independent special counsel must be appointed to lead this (Russia) investigation. At this point, no one in Trumpâ€™s chain of command can be trusted to carry out an impartial investigation.â€?- Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Twitter â€œI find it deeply troubling that this decision comes a day after damning testimony by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Russiaâ€™s ties to the Trump campaign and just days before Comey was scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.â€?- Independent Senator Bernie Sanders  â€œIt is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.â€?- Republican Senator Bob Corker  â€œJames Comey is a man of honor and integrity ... I have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 election. The presidentâ€™s decision to remove the FBI director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.â€? - Republican Senator John McCain  â€œThe need for a special prosecutor is now crystal clear.

Not since Watergate have our legal systems been so threatened.â€?- Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  â€œMr. Comey did not seem to understand some of the laws he was asked to investigate and unfortunately politicized his sensitive position as the FBI director.â€?- Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch â€œFUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonianâ€?- Official Twitter account of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum ",politicsNews,2017/5/10,1

0420,Senators on defensive over all-male healthcare panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barely two days into crafting a new bill to roll back Obamacare, U.S. Senate Republicans were already on the defensive on Tuesday over the absence of any women in their core working group. After a meeting of the Senate healthcare group, lawmakers were bombarded with questions as to why no women were named to the 13-man panel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to explain. â€œThe working group that counts is all 52 of us,â€?McConnell told reporters, referring to all 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber. â€œNobody is being excluded based upon gender ... Everybodyâ€™s at the table. Everybody.â€?Democrats pounced. Republican men are negotiating â€œa secret healthcare plan, which I really hope is not happening in the menâ€™s locker room,â€?said Senator Patty Murray, a member of the Democratic leadership from Washington state.      If the criticism was any sign of what lies ahead as senators try to improve on a rollback bill passed on Thursday by House of Representatives Republicans, it could be a long road ahead. Dismantling the parts of President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law that they dislike and preserving other parts of it is proving to be a difficult task for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. A House of Representativesâ€?plan for doing that, approved last week amid much drama, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Some Republicans eye drafting a similar Senate bill by mid-summer, possibly with the involvement of Democrats. Others indicate the House bill requires major surgery and that the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, could take months.  Regardless of timing, two decisive factors will come into sharper focus soon. One is voter reaction to the House bill, now being voiced in town hall events being hosted nationwide by House members in their home districts. The other factor is an expected analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office of how many million Americans would lose their health insurance coverage under the House bill, if it became law, and how it would affect the U.S. budget deficit. Both the CBO analysis and the town hall events have the potential to do damage to the House legislation, which Trump hailed as a triumph just days ago. Senators are already talking about major changes in the House bill concerning Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and tax subsidies for healthcare coverage. Trying to get past the controversy over the absence of women on the healthcare panel, Senate Republicans said they expected to devote much time to healthcare in the near future.  â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to be talking about much else other than healthcare at least three days a week with all members of our conference present,â€?said Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican. Cornyn said senators would start with the House bill. â€œIf we have to make modifications in order to pass it, weâ€™ll make those modifications and work out the differences with the House.â€?Medicaid was the topic at the Senate working group meeting  Tuesday. The House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. But some Republicans want any reductions to be more gradual, and Trump made a campaign pledge not to cut the program. â€œThere ought to be a glide path where you do not have a cliff that the House provides in 2020,â€?when the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare is abruptly ended, said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. But other Republicans said cutbacks were important to save taxpayer money. â€œThe public wants every dime you can give them. Letâ€™s face it, once you get them on the dole, they are going to take every dime they can. Weâ€™ve got to find some way of getting things under control, or this country and your futureâ€™s going to be gone,â€?said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, a member of the healthcare working group.

0421,U.S. Senate finance panel unlikely to support import tax: chairman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 20 percent import tax, backed by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives, is unlikely to win enough support from the Senate Finance Committee to be part of any Senate tax reform bill, the panelâ€™s Republican chairman said on Tuesday. The comment by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah is the strongest sign yet of the daunting legislative challenge that lies ahead for the border adjustment tax, or BAT, a controversial House Republican proposal that has already divided the business community and Republicans in Congress. Hatchâ€™s finance committee, which consists of 14 Republicans and 12 Democrats, has oversight authority for tax policy and would need to approve any tax reform legislation considered in the Senate. â€œItâ€™s going to be tough to pass. I donâ€™t think we can move it through the Finance Committee,â€?the Utah Republican told reporters after discussing the BAT proposal at a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Hatch said the administration also opposes BAT: â€œTheyâ€™re against that ... if I interpret it correctly.â€?The proposal, which would exempt U.S. export revenues from federal taxation but impose a flat 20 percent tax on imports, is strongly backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady. Neither Ryanâ€™s office nor Bradyâ€™s had an immediate comment on Hatchâ€™s remarks. If the House approved BAT but the Senate excluded it from legislation, House Republicans would need to use bicameral negotiations to get it included in final legislation for President Donald Trumpâ€™s signature. House Republicans have billed border adjustment as a way to meet Trumpâ€™s pledge to create jobs at home while preventing American companies from moving manufacturing jobs and production facilities overseas. But it has divided U.S. business by drawing enthusiastic support from exporters and fierce opposition from import-dependent industries, leaving many Republican lawmakers wary of the proposal. Republican supporters say BAT is needed to pay for steep business tax cuts, citing independent analyses that estimate it would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade. Administration officials have called for financing tax cuts with future economic growth. Some lawmakers have suggested deficit-financed tax cuts instead.        â€œWe have to raise revenue,â€?Hatch said. â€œThereâ€™s no question about that. And we will. We know where it all is anyway.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/9,1
0422,U.S. lawmakers seek looser energy development rules for tribal lands,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to ease restrictions on energy development on U.S. tribal lands has a good chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress this year, after several failed attempts since 2013, the chair of the Senate Indian affairs committee said. Many Republican lawmakers, along with President Donald Trump, have expressed support for more oil drilling, coal mining and other energy projects on Native American reservations, which are overseen by the federal government. Several additional layers of regulatory bureaucracy have slowed those efforts. â€œI think we will be able to get the bill through the House this go around,â€?Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, who authored the bill with seven other Republican Senators, said in a recent interview with Reuters.  He said he believed the bill also had the support of â€œa broad spectrum of tribes across the countryâ€?and would â€œempowerâ€?Native Americans. The bill, dubbed the Tribal Energy Development and Self Determination Act, would authorize tribes to conduct their own energy resource appraisals. It would streamline the permitting process for drilling and mining and provide incentives for tribes to enter into joint-venture agreements with private companies. Former President Barack Obama had opposed a previous House version of theÂ bill in 2015 because it would have exempted tribes from some federal environmental regulations. Other versions were blocked after being rolled into broader bills that were defeated. Tribal lands cover just 2 percent of the nationâ€™s surface but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all remaining U.S. oil and gas reserves. But clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps, compared to a half dozen on private property, according to Reuters interviews conducted in January with tribal leaders, lawyers, oil company executives and federal regulators. Hoeven and Montana Republican Senator Steve Daines joined around a dozen representatives of mineral-rich tribes for a meeting with White House officials last week to discuss ways to reduce those barriers. Tribal participants at the meeting included representatives of the Crow Agency of Montana, the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota, the Navajo Nation and the Southern Ute Indian tribe of Colorado - all tribes that currently produce oil, gas or coal. â€œWe are just trying to amplify our opportunities, change the narrative of Indian country, and establish access to the administration,â€?said C.J. Stewart, a representative of the Crow. ",politicsNews,2017/5/9,1
0423,U.S. Democratic senators seek probe into Icahnâ€™s biofuel credit dealings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight Democratic senators asked U.S. regulators on Tuesday to launch an investigation into billionaire Carl Icahnâ€™s activities in the U.S. biofuels blending credit market, saying the activist investor may have violated trading laws since becoming an adviser to President Donald Trump. â€œWe are writing to request that your agencies investigate whether Carl Icahn violated insider trading laws, anti-market manipulation laws, or any other relevant laws based on his recent actions in the market for renewable fuel credits,â€?the senators said in a letter to the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, was signed by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and five others. The agencies are not required to act on it.  Efforts to reach Icahn for comment were not immediately successful. There have been months of public outcry from Democratic lawmakers and liberal watchdog groups concerned that Icahnâ€™s dual role as a high-powered investor and presidential adviser could lead to conflicts of interest. Trump, a Republican, named Icahn as an unpaid adviser on regulation shortly after Novemberâ€™s election, saying the choice could help him slash red tape and bolster economic growth.  In February, Icahn submitted a proposal to the White House to change the U.S. biofuels program in a way that would ease its regulatory burden on oil refining companies, already struggling with low profit margins. Icahn owns a majority stake in refining company CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N). The White House is considering the proposal. An administration official did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A Reuters review of securities filings last month showed that CVR had accumulated a large short position in biofuels blending credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, which many refiners are required to purchase under the biofuels law. That meant the company would have been in a strong position to profit if RIN prices fell. In their letter, the senators pointed out that RIN prices dropped sharply in late February after Icahnâ€™s proposal on the biofuels regulation was reported. â€œWe have no way of knowing at this time whether Mr. Icahn made any of his renewable fuel credit trades or decisions about trades based on material, non-public information or otherwise manipulated the market,â€?the senators wrote.  â€œBut the publicly available evidence is troubling, and based on this evidence, we ask that your agencies investigate whether Mr. Icahnâ€™s conduct violated any laws under your jurisdiction,â€?they said. Icahn previously dismissed accusations that his proposal to the White House to change the biofuels program was self-serving, saying the overhaul would help other refining companies too, including his competitors.  CVR Energy shares fell 0.4 percent to $22.20 on Tuesday. A CVR spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Icahnâ€™s investment firm, Icahn Enterprises (IEP.O), fell 4.3 percent to $50.82. Icahn, 81, has spent decades doing battle with major companies as an activist investor, and has amassed a fortune that Forbes Magazine pegs above $20 billion. In recent years, he built up an 82 percent stake in CVR, making him a player in the niche biofuels market. â€œCarl Icahn is not shy, and he knows his voice and his actions as special adviser can influence the RIN markets,â€?said Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group that has already asked Congress to investigate whether Icahn had violated any lobbying disclosure laws. â€œThe real issue is did Carl Icahn use his position as special adviser to unduly impact the RIN market and then make corresponding bets on those moves,â€?Slocum said.  CVR Energyâ€™s refining unit (CVRR.N) posted a net gain of $6.4 million associated with the biofuel credits market in the first quarter of 2017, a $50 million turnaround from the year-ago period when CVR shelled out $43.1 million, the company said in a filing. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be blended into the nationâ€™s gasoline and diesel every year. It places that responsibility mainly on refiners, who are required to blend the fuel themselves or purchase credits from others that do it for them. Icahnâ€™s proposal had called for regulators to shift the responsibility for blending from refiners, many of which lack sufficient blending capacity, to terminal operators.  A number of biofuels groups oppose the proposed change, saying it could undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard by making it more complicated, since there are many times more terminal operators than refining companies.  â€œMoving the point of obligation would require a dramatic increase in the staff required to track this at EPA, all while delivering poorer supervision, increasing the complexity of the program, and ultimately higher costs for American drivers,â€?said Growth Energy Chief Executive Emily Skor.

0424,U.S. Republican Graham curious on Trump business deals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he wants to know more about President Donald Trumpâ€™s business dealings in relation to Russia, but that congressional investigations may have to avoid the matter if they conflict with an FBI probe. Graham asked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Monday whether he had concerns about Russian ties to Trumpâ€™s business interests. Clapper said he could not comment because the issue could be a subject of an ongoing investigation. CNN reported on Tuesday that Graham intended to look into Trumpâ€™s business ties to see if any connections exist between Russia and the Trump campaign or the presidentâ€™s associates. The White House said it would welcome any fact-finding by Graham and the subcommittee, which he chairs, saying the president has no business ties to Russia. â€œHe has no business in Russia; he has no connections to Russia,â€?White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. â€œSo he welcomes that.â€?Spicer added that Trump had directed a law firm to send Graham a certified letter stating as much. While Graham expressed interest in finding out whether Trumpâ€™s business interests had any Russia ties, he said the subcommittee may have to â€œsteer clearâ€?of the issue if it conflicts with the FBIâ€™s probe of Russia and the Trump campaign. He clarified later that he had not taken any new actions. â€œThis is nothing new here,â€?he told reporters at the Capitol. â€œIâ€™m not a prosecutor. But if you ask me if I want to know if there are any Trump business ties to Russia that are inappropriate, the answer would be â€˜yes.â€™â€?Graham told CNN it would be helpful to see Trumpâ€™s tax records but that it was too soon to say whether he would be willing to subpoena them, the network said.

0426,U.S. Republican congressman Labrador to run for Idaho governor: Idaho TV station,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. conservative congressman Raul Labrador has decided run for Idaho governor in the 2018 election, which will leave his seat in the House of Representatives up for grabs, KPVI television in Pocatello, Idaho, reported on Tuesday. â€œIdaho needs a proven conservative leader who will stand against the special interests and politicians that have picked the winners and losers in our state Capitol for too long,â€?Labrador said in a statement obtained by the station. â€œIdaho needs a governor who will provide a new vision, a new approach and new leadership,â€?he said in the statement. The four-term congressman was a founding member of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives and was part of a rebel group of conservatives who were a thorn in the side of Republican John Boehner as House speaker. Labrador voted in favor of the Houseâ€™s compromise healthcare reform legislation last week. When confronted by angry constituents at a town hall meeting after the vote, he responded by saying: â€œNobody dies because they donâ€™t have access to healthcare,â€?a comment that provoked outrage on social media.

0427,Trump to make decision on Paris climate pact after G7 summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will not make a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement until after he returns from the May 26-27 Group of Seven summit, the White House said Tuesday. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump is continuing to hear from advisers on the pros and cons of the United States remaining in the global accord. He will make a decision when he returns from the G7 summit in Italy, not prior to that, as originally planned.   â€œItâ€™s a sign that the president wants to continue to meet with his team ... and come to a decision on whatâ€™s (in) the best interest of the United States,â€?Spicer told reporters. Trump advisers had been scheduled to meet at the White House on Tuesday to try to reach a final decision, but a White House official said the meeting was postponed due to scheduling conflicts. His advisers and cabinet chiefs have been split over whether Trump should keep his campaign promise to pull the United States out of the agreement or remain to try to reshape it, according to senior administration officials and several people briefed on the meeting. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are senior presidential advisers, as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are in favor of remaining, while Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and senior adviser Steve Bannon have urged Trump to withdraw.  Advisers had been under pressure to deliver a final recommendation to Trump ahead of the May 26-27 G7 meeting. ",politicsNews,2017/5/9,1
0428,Bipartisan Illinois House group urges Senate to pass budget fix,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 30 Illinois House members on Tuesday threw their support behind efforts in the Senate to craft a bill package aimed at ending the stateâ€™s historic budget impasse. â€œWe ask the senators from both parties to pass the best negotiated package they can, and then we will take up their work in the House,â€?the group said in a statement.  The package, which includes tax hikes, pension changes and a local property tax freeze, stalled in the Democratic-led Senate in March, when most Republicans withdrew their support. John Patterson, a spokesman for Senate President John Cullerton, said on Tuesday both sides are â€œtrading ideas in trying to find agreement.â€?Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a standoff between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers face a May 31 deadline to pass budget bills with simple majority votes. The bipartisan House statement surfaced after House Speaker Michael Madigan on Monday urged Governor Bruce Rauner to restart budget negotiations and appointed four top Democrats from his chamber to work on a deal. Meanwhile, the Chicago-based Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance watchdog, released a report on Tuesday calling for an end to piecemeal funding that has kept the nationâ€™s fifth-largest state operating. â€œThe governor and General Assembly need to end this unacceptable stalemate by passing and enacting a comprehensive plan,â€?Civic Federation President Laurence Msall said in a statement. â€œCherry-picking certain areas of government to fund while pledging to work toward a complete budget sometime in the abstract future has not and will not end the crisis and in fact is making it worse.â€?Illinoisâ€?reliance on continuing appropriations, court-ordered spending and partial budgets has ballooned an unpaid bill backlog from $9.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 to more than $13 billion in fiscal 2017. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza told a Senate committee on Tuesday that late payment penalties owed to vendors total about $800 million. Eleni Demertzis, a Rauner spokeswoman, said the governor continues to push for â€œa truly balanced budget with structural reforms.â€? Major rating agencies, which have pushed Illinois down the credit scale six times since Rauner took office in January 2015, have indicated the stateâ€™s triple-B bond ratings could fall closer to junk in the absence of a fiscal fix.

0430,Obama confident U.S. will move in right direction on climate,"MILAN (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he was confident that the United States would keep moving â€œin the right directionâ€?on climate change, although the process might slow down under the current administration.      Before taking office, President Donald Trump pledged to cancel a deal signed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, which aims to limit rising temperatures by phasing out use of fossil fuels. Trump, who wants to boost the U.S. coal industry, is expected to announce in the coming days whether he will scrap an accord for which his predecessor campaigned. Just over three months after leaving office, Obama told a food industry conference in Milan that climate change was a challenge â€œthat will define the contours of this century more dramatically, perhaps, than any otherâ€? He urged big industrialized countries such as the United States and China to lead the way.  â€œBecause of current debate in Washington, it could be that policies move more slowly but I am confident that the United States will continue to move in the right direction,â€?he said. Policy-making in the last decade has prompted the private sector to invest in both renewable energy and technology to improve fuel efficiency, Obama said.  The United States committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 - a level that Trump is unlikely to support.     The European Union has been scrambling to persuade Trump to stick to the deal. Many U.S. companies and several Republican lawmakers, who see it as a way to protect American industrial interests overseas, have also urged him to stay in. The Paris treaty did not set high enough standards to solve the issue entirely, Obama said but â€œit put together the architecture and mechanism so that each country can reduce its problem of emissionsâ€?

0431,"Senior U.S. senator pushes Trump on Russia, French election","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. lawmaker pushed President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Tuesday to respond to concerns that Russia was responsible for a hacking attack on the campaign of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron. â€œMr. Macronâ€™s victory in Sundayâ€™s election does not diminish the need for the Trump Administration to take this attack seriously and to work closely with the French government to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent similar attacks from taking place in the future,â€?Senator Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, wrote in a letter to administration officials, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Jeff Sessions, Trumpâ€™s attorney general, has removed himself from probes of Russian election interference after failing to disclose his meetings with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States. â€œQuite frankly it is the height of irresponsibility that President Trump still denies Russiaâ€™s act of cyber war against our election,â€?Durbin wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters. Durbin asked for information, including how the administration was responding to such attacks, and said Trumpâ€™s attitude could result in inadequate efforts to help U.S. allies and U.S. states protect against future Russian hacking. Russia denies allegations that it has sought to meddle in foreign elections. Trump has also pushed back against suggestions that his surprise victory in November was boosted by Moscowâ€™s efforts.

Key advisers to President Donald Trump and cabinet officials were due to convene at the White House to resolve an internal debate over whether Trump should keep his campaign promise to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement, according to senior administration officials and several people briefed on the meeting. The White House official did not say when the meeting would be rescheduled.  The meeting was meant to lay the groundwork for a formal proposal to Trump, who has promised to announce a decision before a Group of Seven summit at the end of May. Ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s originally planned meeting, business groups and some lawmakers called on the White House to remain in the Paris agreement, while some conservative policy groups urged the advisers to recommend a withdrawal. Meanwhile, representatives of nearly 200 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are meeting in Bonn this week to discuss technical aspects of implementing the accord.

0434,Senate confirms Heather Wilson as Trump's Air Force secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate easily confirmed Heather Wilson, a former Republican member of the House of Representatives, on Monday to be President Donald Trumpâ€™s secretary of the Air Force. The vote was 76-22 in favor of Wilson becoming the top civilian overseeing the Air Force. The 22 â€œnoâ€?votes all came from Democrats. At her confirmation hearing in March, Wilson praised the stealth capability of Lockheed Martin Corpâ€™s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet, in remarks suggesting the Pentagonâ€™s most expensive weapons system would have an important advocate. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and former Rhodes scholar, Wilson, 56, has been president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology since 2013. She was a House member from New Mexico from 1998 to 2009 and had served on the National Security Council under President George H.W. Bush. ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0435,Former Trump security aide was Russia blackmail risk: ex-U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said on Monday she warned the White House in January that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. Yates testified at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on Flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. Yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. Yates briefly led the U.S. Justice Department until Trump fired her on Jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. She told White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26, less than a week into Trumpâ€™s presidency, that Flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington. Making her first public statements about the issue, Yates said she feared Moscow could try to blackmail Flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential Trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.                  Yates told the hearing she had been concerned that â€œthe national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.â€?â€œLogic would tell you that you donâ€™t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,â€?she said. Trump, who continued to praise Flynn, waited 18 days after Yatesâ€?warning before Flynnâ€™s forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Several Democratic senators questioned Trumpâ€™s delay. Yates said that in her meetings, McGahn â€œdemonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. If nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning.â€?During that section of the hearing, Clapper described as accurate a report in the Guardian newspaper that British intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian agents, and that the information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies. â€œYes, it is (accurate), and itâ€™s also quite sensitive,â€?Clapper said. Yates was a holdover from the administration of President Barack Obama. Obama had warned Trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to Flynn just after the Republicanâ€™s surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election, a former Obama aide said.     The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Obama had communicated concerns about Flynn. It â€œshouldnâ€™t come as a surprise to anyone, given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obamaâ€™s shortcomings,â€?Spicer said.     Obama pushed Flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the militaryâ€™s Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA. Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. The main investigations are being conducted by congressional Intelligence Committees, although Democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. They argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. After Mondayâ€™s hearing, Trump took to Twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. â€œDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is â€˜no evidenceâ€?of collusion w/ Russia and Trump,â€?he said. And in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. â€œThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?â€?he asked. FBI Director James Comey testified in the House on March 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between Trump associates and Moscowâ€™s attempts to tilt the election. Trump had also used Twitter before the hearing to insinuate that Yates had leaked information on Flynn to the media. Yates and Clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. Questioning on Monday often broke along party lines.     Some Republicans veered away from Russia to focus on issues such as whether the Obama administration had improperly revealed the names of Trump associates contained in surveillance records.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, was one of a handful who grilled Yates about her objections to Trumpâ€™s travel ban. Trump fired Yates after she defied the White House on the travel ban, a policy that Trump said would help protect Americans from Islamist militants. ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0436,Trump review of Wall Street rules to be done in stages: sources,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. governmentâ€™s review of a landmark 2010 financial reform law will not be complete by early June as originally targeted, and officials will now report findings piece-by-piece, with priority given to banking regulations, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. President Donald Trump has pledged to do a â€œbig numberâ€?on the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which raised banksâ€?capital requirements, restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customersâ€?money and created consumer protections in the wake of the financial crisis. In February, Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review the law and report back within 120 days, saying his administration expected to be cutting large parts of it.  But the Treasury Department is still filling vacancies after the transition from the Obama administration and there are not  enough officials to get the full review done by early June, three sources said. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the idea the report that would be broken up because the department is short-handed, saying the reach of the project could require several separate reports, as permitted under the executive order. â€œTreasury has an entire team dedicated to reviewing the financial regulatory rules and will begin reporting our findings to the president in June,â€?the department spokesperson said. â€œGiven the volume and scope of the issues we are reviewing that involve potential changes to the financial regulatory system, we are carefully considering the best options to begin rolling them out in the most effective and responsible manner,â€?the spokesperson said. The Treasury Department will first report back on what banking rules could be changed, including capital requirements, restrictions on leverage and speculative trading. Examinations of capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later, the sources said. It could be several months until these other stages of the financial reform review are completed, some of the sources said.  The piecemeal approach could create challenges for some sectors if parts of the report are significantly delayed. The report has been highly anticipated, as it marks the new administrationâ€™s most detailed foray into outlining what it wants to do with financial rules. Trump previously has spoken only in broad terms about easing regulation surrounding lending.    Any efforts to rework existing regulations or craft new legislation will be a lengthy and contentious process, something that banking lobbyists have said will make any delay to the administrationâ€™s initial findings costly for businesses eager for regulatory relief. Former BlackRock Inc executive Craig Phillips is leading the administrationâ€™s plan for financial deregulation. Alongside other Treasury officials, he is soliciting feedback from banking industry groups and executives for how banking policy should be shaped. The change in the timing of the Treasury report comes after Trump ordered a separate review of some key planks of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. In April, Trump signed a pair of executive orders directing a review of two additional regulatory powers - orderly liquidation authority, which allows regulators to step in and wind down a failing financial institution, and systemic designation, in which certain large firms may be deemed critical to the overall health of the financial system, meriting stricter oversight.  The findings from those reviews are not expected until October. ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0437,Judges hit Trump lawyer with tough questions over revised travel ban,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges on Monday peppered a U.S. Justice Department lawyer with tough questions about President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority nations, with several voicing skepticism that protecting national security was the aim of the policy, not religious bias. Six Democratic appointees on a court dominated by judges named by Democratic presidents showed concerns about reviving the Republican presidentâ€™s March executive order that prohibited new visas to enter the United States for citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for three months. But three Republican appointees on the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to lean toward the administration, asking whether the president should be second-guessed when it comes to protecting the countryâ€™s borders and whether the plaintiffs bringing the suit had been sufficiently harmed by the order during arguments before 13 judges.  Based on the judgesâ€?questions, a ruling could hinge on whether the appeals court agrees with a lower court judge that past statements by Trump about the need to prevent Muslims from entering the United States should be taken into account. That would be bad news for a young administration seeking victory on one of its first policy changes. â€œThis is not a Muslim ban,â€?Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing for the government, told the judges during the hearing that lasted two hours, twice as long as scheduled. Judge Robert King, named by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, told Wall that Trump has never retracted previous comments about wanting to impose a ban on Muslims.  â€œHeâ€™s never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban,â€?King said, referring to Trumpâ€™s campaign promise for a â€œtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€?  Wall told the judges past legal precedent holds that the court should not look behind the text of the Trumpâ€™s executive order, which does not mention any specific religion, to get at its motivations. He warned that despite the â€œheated and passionate political debateâ€?about the ban, there was a need to be careful not to set legal precedent that would open the door to broader questioning of presidential decision making on security matters. Judge Paul Niemeyer, appointed by Republican former President George H.W. Bush, told Omar Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the plaintiffs who challenged the order, that they were asking the court to rule on a presidentâ€™s national security judgments.   â€œYou have the judiciary supervising and assessing how the executive is carrying out his office,â€?Niemeyer said, pressing Jadwat, who seemed to stumble at times after pointed questioning by the judges. â€œI just donâ€™t know where this stops.â€?The revised travel ban was challenged in Maryland by refugee organizations and individuals who said they were being discriminated against because they were Muslim and because they had family members adversely affected by the ban. They argue the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s First Amendment barring the government from favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. The administration appealed a March 15 ruling by Maryland-based federal judge Theodore Chuang that put the ban on hold just a day before it was due to go into effect. The arguments marked the latest legal test for Trumpâ€™s ban, which also was blocked by federal judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii in a separate legal challenge. An earlier version of the ban was also blocked by the courts. Chuang, in Maryland, blocked the part of Trumpâ€™s order relating to travel by people from the six countries. Watson, in Hawaii, also blocked another part of the order that suspended the entry of refugees into the United States for four months. To a packed audience in the ornate pre-Civil War era courthouse, Judge Pamela Harris said Trumpâ€™s action clearly had a disparate impact on Muslims, asking, â€œHow is this neutral in its operation as to Muslims?â€?Judge Barbara Keenan, who like Harris was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the order could affect some 200 million people. Regardless of how the 13 judges rule, the matter is likely to be decided ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court. The full 4th Circuit took up the appeal but two Republican-appointed judges did not participate. That left nine judges appointed by Democratic presidents, three Republican appointees and one judge originally appointed by a Democrat and later re-appointed by a Republican. It was unclear when the court would rule. Trump issued the March executive order after federal courts blocked an earlier version, issued on Jan. 27 a week after he took office, that also had included Iraq among the nations targeted. That order, which went into effect immediately, triggered chaos and protests at airports and in several cities before being put on hold due to legal challenges. The second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban. The administrationâ€™s appeal in the Hawaii case will be heard in Seattle on May 15 by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The three judges assigned all are Democratic appointees. Wall said the temporary ban was intended to give the government time to evaluate whether people from the six countries were being subjected to adequate vetting to ensure they did not pose a security threat to the United States. But he said the administration had not been able to proceed on all the work it wanted to do because of the litigation, noting â€œwe have put our pens down.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0438,"Rice chides Trump for criticism of judges, media","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Monday she would prefer that President Donald Trump not criticize judges and the media but that U.S. democratic institutions can withstand such comments. Speaking in an interview, Rice also described Trump as having a somewhat â€œtransactionalâ€?view of foreign relations but she broadly endorsed his approach of seeking to enlist Chinaâ€™s help to get North Korea to rein in its nuclear program. Asked about Trump lashing out at judges when rulings go against him and describing the media as â€œthe enemy of the people,â€?Rice replied: â€œItâ€™s language that I would prefer not to hear. â€œBut I donâ€™t think that you can erode the scaffolding of democracy in the United States,â€?she added during a tour to promote her book â€œDemocracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom.â€? Rice, national security adviser and secretary of state under Republican former President George W. Bush, is now a professor at Stanford University. She described U.S. institutions as â€œvery strongâ€?and said Trump â€œmay have even found himself a bit surprised by how constraining that scaffolding really is.â€?Courts have blocked parts of two Trump executive orders that sought to temporarily ban entry to the United States for people from six Muslim-majority countries. In a 30-minute interview, Rice said the United States needed to find a way to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election but without engaging in â€˜tit-for-tatâ€?retaliation by meddling in Russian elections. She suggested prosecuting anyone in the United States who took part in what intelligence agencies believe was a deliberate effort to sway the presidential election in Trumpâ€™s favor, and to consider putting sanctions, such as visa bans, on people who did so from abroad. Rice, who has interspersed periods in public service with  academic posts, suggested Trump, a New York real estate magnate, may see foreign policy more in terms of striking deals than finding common interests. Before meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, Trump suggested China might get better trade deals with the United States if it put more pressure on North Korea to restrain its nuclear and missile programs. â€œThe president still has a kind of transactional view of international politics but, in fact, interests are more enduring than transactions,â€?Rice said. However, Rice endorsed Trumpâ€™s policy of trying to enlist Chinese help against North Korea, which is believed to have conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 and to be developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike the U.S. mainland. China, the Northâ€™s main trading partner and the closest thing it has to an ally, has historically been unwilling to tighten the economic screws on Pyongyang for fear of triggering a collapse and sending millions of refugees across the border. Rice said the U.S. task was to convince the Chinese that they had to choose between doing â€œreally hard things to bring this regime into line or we will have to do harsh things.â€?The former secretary of state also said North Koreaâ€™s current leader, Kim Jong Un, is far less predictable than his father, Kim Jong Il, and may not be fully rational. â€œKim Jong Un is far more reckless than his father ... I wonder if he is not a little unhinged,â€?she said. â€œI wonder if the Chinese arenâ€™t beginning to reconsider their view that ... a stable North Korean regime, even if it is nuclear-armed, is better than an unstable one.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0439,Texas governor signs into law bill to punish 'sanctuary cities',"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on Sunday a measure to punish â€œsanctuary cities,â€?despite a plea from police chiefs of the stateâ€™s biggest cities to halt the bill they said would hinder their ability to fight crime. The Texas measure comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. â€œAs governor, my top priority is public safety, and this bill furthers that objective by keeping dangerous criminals off our streets,â€?Abbott said in a statement.Â The law will take effect on Sept. 1. The Republican-dominated legislature passed the bill on party-line votes and sent the measure to Abbott earlier this month. It would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration agents. Police officials found to be in violation of the law could face removal from office, fines and up to a year in prison if convicted. The measure also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jaywalking. Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge in April blocked Trumpâ€™s executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws. Democrats have warned the measure could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling and civil rights groups have promised to fight the Texas measure in court. â€œThis legislation is bad for Texas and will make our communities more dangerous for all,â€?the police chiefs of cities including Houston and Dallas wrote in an opinion piece in the Dallas Morning News in late April.  They said immigration was a federal obligation and the law would stretch already meager resources by turning local police into immigration agents. The police chiefs said the measure would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities, creating a class of silent victims and eliminating the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes. One of the sponsors of the bill, Republican state Representative Charlie Geren, said in House debate the bill would have no effect on immigrants in the country illegally if they had not committed a crime.  He also added there were no sanctuary cities in Texas at present and the measure would prevent any from emerging. ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0440,Obama 'made it known' he was no fan of Flynn: White House spokesman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama made clear he did not support Michael Flynn during a meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump, the White House said on Monday. â€œItâ€™s true that the president, President Obama, made it known that he wasnâ€™t exactly a fan of General Flynnâ€™s,â€?during their one-hour meeting, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing. Obama and Trump met at the Oval Office on Nov. 10, two days after the Republicanâ€™s election victory. Spicer was asked about new reports that Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn, who was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Democratic presidentâ€™s term, as national security adviser. Trump later dismissed Flynn  after less than a month over his contacts with Russian officials.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1

0442,Former Trump security aide was Russia blackmail risk: ex-U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said on Monday she warned the White House in January that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. Yates testified at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on Flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. Yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. Yates briefly led the U.S. Justice Department until Trump fired her on Jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. She told White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26, less than a week into Trumpâ€™s presidency, that Flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington. Making her first public statements about the issue, Yates said she feared Moscow could try to blackmail Flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential Trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.                  Yates told the hearing she had been concerned that â€œthe national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.â€?â€œLogic would tell you that you donâ€™t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,â€?she said. Trump, who continued to praise Flynn, waited 18 days after Yatesâ€?warning before Flynnâ€™s forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Several Democratic senators questioned Trumpâ€™s delay. Yates said that in her meetings, McGahn â€œdemonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. If nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning.â€?During that section of the hearing, Clapper described as accurate a report in the Guardian newspaper that British intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian agents, and that the information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies. â€œYes, it is (accurate), and itâ€™s also quite sensitive,â€?Clapper said. Yates was a holdover from the administration of President Barack Obama. Obama had warned Trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to Flynn just after the Republicanâ€™s surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election, a former Obama aide said.     The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Obama had communicated concerns about Flynn. It â€œshouldnâ€™t come as a surprise to anyone, given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obamaâ€™s shortcomings,â€?Spicer said.     Obama pushed Flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the militaryâ€™s Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA. Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. The main investigations are being conducted by congressional Intelligence Committees, although Democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. They argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. After Mondayâ€™s hearing, Trump took to Twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. â€œDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is â€˜no evidenceâ€?of collusion w/ Russia and Trump,â€?he said. And in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. â€œThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?â€?he asked. FBI Director James Comey testified in the House on March 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between Trump associates and Moscowâ€™s attempts to tilt the election. Trump had also used Twitter before the hearing to insinuate that Yates had leaked information on Flynn to the media. Yates and Clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. Questioning on Monday often broke along party lines.     Some Republicans veered away from Russia to focus on issues such as whether the Obama administration had improperly revealed the names of Trump associates contained in surveillance records.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, was one of a handful who grilled Yates about her objections to Trumpâ€™s travel ban. Trump fired Yates after she defied the White House on the travel ban, a policy that Trump said would help protect Americans from Islamist militants. ",politicsNews,2017/5/8,1
0443,Reporters barred from Kushner Companies' event in China,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Organizers barred journalists on Sunday from a publicly advertised event in Shanghai that offered Chinese investors the chance to get U.S. immigrant visas if they put money in a real estate project linked to the family of President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law. The two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, One Journal Square, is being developed by KABR Group and the Kushner Companies, which until recently was headed by senior White House advisor Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the eventâ€™s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai. The controversial EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. â€œSorry, this is a private event,â€?said a man stopping journalists from entering a function room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. Guests at the event said Kushnerâ€™s sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, spoke for about 10 minutes, including about her familyâ€™s humble roots. According to the New York Times, Meyer attended a similar event in Beijing on Saturday and told the audience of about 100 people the project â€œmeans a lot to me and my entire familyâ€? Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.  â€œMr. Kushner has no involvement in the operation of Kushner Companies and divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife, and his children are not beneficiaries of, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics,â€?his lawyer, Blake Roberts of WilmerHale law firm, said in a statement emailed to Reuters by the White House. â€œAs previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program.â€?A Kushner Companies spokeswoman declined to comment in a New York Times article about the Beijing event published on Saturday. The Times story said Meyer did not respond when asked if she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother. Journalists from the Times and Washington Post were removed from Saturdayâ€™s Beijing event, the newspapers reported. One potential investor, Sophie Xing, said a â€œvery importantâ€?factor in her decision to attend Sundayâ€™s event was the fact the project was a Kushner Companies investment and that Trumpâ€™s son-in-lawâ€™s sister would be in Shanghai. â€œActually I really donâ€™t know how close they are but I felt that this was a pretty good project,â€?she said. In a promotional text message seen by Reuters, Qiaowai made note of Meyerâ€™s relationship to Trump and called her the eventâ€™s â€œheavyweight honored guestâ€? Qiaowai representatives at the event declined to answer questions from journalists, and calls to its listed phone number went unanswered. Qiaowai is also known as QWOS. Its promotional materials for the project, which it also calls Kushner1, advertise the prospect of putting money in under the federal EB-5 program. The program is popular among wealthy Chinese looking to shift assets abroad or move overseas, but it has come under fire in the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for changing or abolishing  the EB-5 program, but the scheme was recently renewed by Congress until Sept. 30. Potential investor Xing said a Kushner representative who spoke on Sunday stressed that EB-5 rules could change after September to raise the minimum required investment. Another person who attended Sundayâ€™s event, Liu Guoqi, was mindful of the potential rule change. Liu said he had been to previous pitches for EB-5 investments but had concerns about the risks. â€œThe whole thing may change later this year so we feel that there isnâ€™t much time left,â€?he said. In the United States, the EB-5 program has also sparked concerns about possible scams. Some immigrants have been burned by misrepresentations made about the program by promoters, both inside and outside the United States. Many have lost not only their money but their chance at winning U.S. citizenship. Trump has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration. In addition to Beijing and Shanghai, the road show for One Journal Square was scheduled to visit the Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan, according to Qiaowaiâ€™s marketing materials online. It calls the Kushner family a â€œfamous real estate clanâ€? and touts EB-5 immigration as â€œpeace of mindâ€? Qiaowaiâ€™s Chinese-language marketing material describes the project as â€œsupported by the government, created by a star developerâ€? and says the project is its 87th EB-5 program.

0444,Democrats criticize Senate's all-male healthcare group,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats on Sunday criticized the lack of women on a working group in the Republican-led Senate that will craft a plan to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. As the Senate begins to wrestle with a Republican healthcare bill narrowly approved by the House of Representatives last week, senators questioned why the 13-member working group put together by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell does not include any of the chamberâ€™s five Republican women. â€œWomenâ€™s health is a big part of this and women are a majority of the population, and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform,â€?Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€?Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington wrote on Twitter: â€œIt matters to have women at the table â€?and it matters when they arenâ€™t.â€?Republicans pushed their healthcare restructuring through the House on a 217-213 vote, handing President Donald Trump his first major legislative success. But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority and several members have suggested they will develop their own plans. Democrats are united in opposition to the House bill. Trump pledged on Sunday that the effort to gut former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law would be successful. â€œRepublican Senators will not let the American People down!,â€?he wrote on Twitter. â€œObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up-it was a lie and it is dead!â€?The Senateâ€™s healthcare working group includes the Republican leadership, several committee chairmen and a combination of conservatives such as Ted Cruz of Texas and more moderate Republicans from politically important swing states such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Critics said the groupâ€™s lack of diversity would eliminate crucial viewpoints. â€œThe GOP is crafting policy on an issue that directly impacts women without including a single woman in the process. Itâ€™s wrong,â€?Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Don Stewart, a senior aide to McConnell, said critics were getting â€œhung up on processâ€?while ignoring the problems of Obamacare such as higher costs and limited choices. â€œSo you can get caught up in process, or you can focus on the actual reality,â€?Stewart said in an email on Sunday. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has been working on her own healthcare plan, said she was reaching out to moderate Democrats to try to find common ground. She did not criticize the working groupâ€™s all-male make-up but said she wanted to see a broader effort to replace Obamaâ€™s 2010 healthcare law. â€œI would like to see us put together a bipartisan group to solve this problem, of Democrats who acknowledge there are problems with the current law, that it is not working well in several states, and Republicans who also want to make sure that weâ€™re not reducing coverage and weâ€™re giving flexibility,â€?Collins said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week.â€?Senators have questioned aspects of the House bill, which would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of its expansion during the Obama administration. It also would allow states to opt out of some existing protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. While insurers could not deny insurance because of such conditions, they would be allowed to decide how much to charge. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most moderate Democrats in the Senate, said his state â€œgets absolutely slammedâ€?in the House bill because it has a lot of elderly residents and people with pre-existing conditions. â€œI just want to work and sit down and try to get something done, but no oneâ€™s asked us,â€?he said on CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nationâ€?program. â€œOur congressional delegation says, â€˜donâ€™t worry, the Senate will fix it.â€?And no one has asked any Democrat. And I am the most centrist.â€?White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the White House would not dictate the process. â€œI think we want to let them do their work, let them work this out. They are all very mature. They all know what is going on. They all know the commitments we have made to the American people to repeal and replace a failing program in Obamacare,â€?he said on the â€œFox News Sundayâ€?program. ",politicsNews,2017/5/7,1
0445,Sanders defends Trump's praise of Australian healthcare system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Saturday that President Donald Trump was right to call Australiaâ€™s universal healthcare system better than the U.S. system. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, also said the Senate should use the Australian system as a model while crafting an alternative to Republican healthcare legislation that Trump endorses. â€œPresident Trump is right. The Australian healthcare system provides healthcare to all of its people at a fraction of the cost than we do,â€?Sanders commented on Twitter. The tweet was accompanied by a short video that set out the virtues of Australiaâ€™s universal healthcare system, saying it guarantees better service to all Australians at about half the cost of U.S. healthcare. The video also noted that Australians can expect to live longer than Americans, on average.  Sandersâ€?tweet came two days after Trump told Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in New York: â€œYou have better healthcare than we do.â€?The presidentâ€™s comment raised eyebrows, coming just after the U.S. House of Representatives had approved a Trump-backed bill that would overturn much of former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law and move the U.S. system further away from universal coverage. The White House later said Trump was simply being nice to an ally and does not think the United States should adopt Australiaâ€™s healthcare approach.    The healthcare legislation that Trump endorses would pare back insurance protections for the sick, and, according to nonpartisan congressional researchers, would lead to 24 million more Americans being without health coverage by 2026. But the billâ€™s approval in the House on Thursday sent the legislation to the Senate, where it has little support. â€œWe will take this pathetic healthcare bill, throw it in the garbage can and do something that will work for ordinary Americans instead,â€?Sanders said in a second Saturday tweet. A Vermont independent, Sanders has become more influential in the Senate since 2016, when he took his long-shot presidential bid and turned it into a political movement against inequality.

0446,U.S. environmental chief to recuse himself from court cases,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has recused himself from several court cases that he pursued against the agency when he was Oklahoma attorney general, according to a recusal statement. Pruitt, who had sued the environmental agency more than a dozen times when he was the oil- and gas-producing stateâ€™s top legal officer, had pledged during his Senate confirmation that he would step aside from ongoing cases if the agencyâ€™s ethics panel required it. Environmental groups have contended that his litigation as Oklahoma attorney general may have been influenced by energy companies and industry groups that contributed to his election campaigns. â€œThis recusal statement addresses all of my ethics obligations,â€?Pruitt said in the four-page statement, which was dated May 4. It was first reported by the E&E News website, which obtained the statement under the Freedom of Information Act. Pruitt said he would not participate for one year after his Senate confirmation in matters involving four parties. They include Oklahoma and the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a public policy group involving Republican attorneys general that targeted environmental rules. Pruitt also recused himself from a dozen pending cases involving the EPA. They include lawsuits over the Clean Power Plan and cases in both federal appeals and district courts over the Clean Water Act, which expanded the number of federally protected waterways. Republican President Donald Trump signed an order in March undoing the Clean Power Plan and other climate change rules that had been imposed by his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama.

0447,New contender emerges to become Wall Street's top cop: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - David Miller, a white collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, hasÂ emergedÂ as a candidate to succeed Preet Bharara as the next Manhattan U.S. attorney, according to people familiar with the matter. Miller, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in New York, has in recent weeks spoken with officials in the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House as well as members of Congress about the job, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private discussions. The administrationâ€™s interest in Miller for the prestigious post has not been previously reported. Edward McNally, a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres, has been viewed as the leading candidate among at least four people said to have been under consideration, according to sources and media reports. It is not clear who is now favored to get the position, which requires the Presidentâ€™s nomination and is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Spokespeople for Morgan Lewis, Kasowitz and the Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House did not respond to questions about Miller as a candidate. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is considered one of the most important posts in the U.S. justice system. It entails overseeing more than 200 prosecutors handling high-profile cases ranging from terrorism to wrongdoing on Wall Street, cyber attacks and corruption. In addition to Wall Street cases, whoever is chosen will inherit the officeâ€™s investigation into a scandal at Fox News Channel over payments to settle sexual harassment claims and the prosecution of a Turkish gold trader in a politically charged case that has angered Turkeyâ€™s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Miller, 43, was an assistant U.S. attorney under Bharara from 2009 to 2014. During that time he was on a team of prosecutors involved in the officeâ€™s crackdown on insider trading and was lead counsel in prosecutions of narcotics-related cases, as well as mail fraud and embezzlement schemes. Bhararaâ€™s former deputy Joon Kim is currently acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney. Bharara was fired in March after refusing to resign along with 45 other U.S. attorneys from the Obama administration. The dismissal was a surprise because Bharara was asked by Trump in November to stay on. Bharara had built a strong reputation as Wall Streetâ€™s top cop and for going after political corruption, regardless of party. Both Millerâ€™s and McNallyâ€™s law firms have ties to U.S. President Donald Trump. Sheri Dillon, a partner at Morgan Lewis, took part in  Trumpâ€™s January news conference on his plans to avoid conflicts of interest.Â Kasowitz has handled various cases for Trump for more than a decade and David Friedman, a former name partner at the firm, was confirmed in March as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Miller and McNally are both Republicans. Before his stint under Bharara, Miller served as a trial attorney in the Justice Departmentâ€™s counterterrorism section and as assistant general counsel for the Central Intelligence Agency. While at the CIA, he assisted in prosecuting Lewis â€œScooterâ€?Libby, who was found guilty of lying and obstructing a probe into who blew the cover of a CIA officer in a case that fueled debate over the Iraq war. Millerâ€™s former and current colleagues described him as a talented, â€œby-the-bookâ€?lawyer who - if chosen - could be expected to protect the officeâ€™s culture of independence.   â€œDavid Miller would be a fine choice,â€?said Carrie Cohen, a partner at Morrison Foerster whose time as a prosecutor in Manhattan overlapped with Millerâ€™s. Â â€œAppointing someone who previously worked in the office bodes well for bringing the types of cases it has historically brought, without fear or favor.â€Â?McNally, 61, has had a wide-ranging career in law and government. He was interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois in late 2005 and 2006 and, during the 1980s, he worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s office in Manhattan under Rudolph Giuliani.Â  He also has served as a White House speechwriter under President George H.W. Bush, was general counsel for homeland security and terrorism and spent three years as senior counsel in the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Other names that have cropped up in media reports as contenders for the post are Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer whose father served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush andÂ Edward Oâ€™Callaghan, a partner at Clifford Chance. Oâ€™Callaghan and Mukasey did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Besides Giuliani, who went on to become New York City Mayor and more recently a Trump adviser, past U.S. Attorneys forÂ ManhattanÂ include James Comey, now FBI director, and Robert Morgenthau, who was the inspiration for the first district attorney on the television series, â€œLaw & Order.â€?According to his Linkedin profile, Miller has made a foray into television as a consultant forÂ â€œBillions,â€?aÂ Showtime TV drama that was reportedly inspired in part by Bhararaâ€™s investigation into hedge fund manager Steven Cohen.

0448,How one U.S. state is leading the charge to dismantle Obamacare,"FRANKFORT, Ky./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For nearly three years, Democrats and former President Barack Obama pointed to Kentucky as one of the Affordable Care Actâ€™s biggest success stories. A poor, rural state that straddles the North and South, Kentucky was an early adopter of the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare and saw one of the countryâ€™s largest drops in the uninsured rate. Now Kentucky is poised for a new distinction: to be the first state to save money by reducing the number of people on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled and a central tenet of Obamacare. If successful, Kentucky would provide a roadmap for other states who are worried about paying an increasing share for people on Medicaid.  A new Republican health law that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, along with state initiatives like Kentuckyâ€™s, would dramatically change the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years.  The Republican bill still faces a long road ahead in the U.S. Senate and its final passage is far from assured, making initiatives like Kentuckyâ€™s all the more important.  Kentucky has proposed to lessen its financial burden before it grows by reducing the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million in the process. (For a graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2on0HVK) Kentuckyâ€™s plan also calls for new work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance. Plus, it would establish new fees for all members based on income and lock out some people who miss a payment or fail to re-enroll. By following these proposed rules, Kentucky believes Medicaid enrollees will over time graduate from Medicaid to private and employer insurance plans.  â€œOne of the most remarkable lies that has perpetrated in recent years in the healthcare community in America is that expanded Medicaid was working well in Kentucky,â€?Republican Governor Matt Bevin, who is leading the state effort, told Reuters from the governorâ€™s mansion in Frankfort, Kentucky. That view is in line with President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration, which has criticized Obamacareâ€™s Medicaid expansion and urged states to pursue similar Medicaid reforms to what Kentucky is now attempting.  â€œIf Kentucky is successful, youâ€™ll see this spread through the more conservative-leaning states. Itâ€™s possible even a Democratic blue state could do it,â€?said George Huang, director and senior municipal healthcare research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. â€œItâ€™s the flexibility that some states are seeking.â€? Kentucky, a state Trump won handily last November, has been devastated by the loss of coal mining jobs and an opioid epidemic. The state sits near the bottom of health rankings for smoking rates, cancer deaths and diabetes. â€œTo me, morally, it was the right thing to expand Medicaid, but I had a responsibility to not to do something that would bankrupt the state,â€?said former Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, referring to the increased costs of caring for a larger population with Medicaid insurance. More than 30 states, about a dozen of which are led by Republican governors, expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. In Kentucky, more than 400,000 people gained health insurance through the program, the highest growth rate of Medicaid coverage of any state. Beshear commissioned independent studies by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte on the financial and health impacts of expanding Medicaid. Both studies found health and economic gains. Deloitte reported that 90,000 newly covered residents received cholesterol screening and 80,000 got preventative dental care within a year. It estimated Kentucky would see an economic boost of $30 billion and 40,000 new jobs by 2021. Beshearâ€™s successor, Republican Governor Bevin, was elected in 2015 on a promise to repeal and replace the healthcare law on the view that thousands of Kentuckians had unaffordable premiums and only one health insurer to choose from. He dismissed the projections in the Beshear-commissioned studies as â€œpreposterous,â€?and says the stateâ€™s share of expanded Medicaid - $74 million in 2017 and totaling $1.2 billion over five years - was too expensive and unsustainable.  â€œWe want this to be a helping hand for people at a time when they need it, but then be able to return to the commercial marketplace,â€?Bevin said.  Last year, Bevin submitted the waiver to restrict Medicaid eligibility by requiring enrollees to work or volunteer at least 20 hours per week and to pay monthly premiums based on income. Heâ€™s still awaiting approval. Bevin said he has spoken with several governors about the waiver and has had extensive conversations with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price about fast-tracking the approval process in order for other states to quickly adopt similar programs. Such conversations are occurring across the country in response to encouragement from the new administration to reform state Medicaid programs, said Alleigh Marre, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman.  Louisiana and Wisconsin are considering work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. The Obama administration rejected previous attempts by other states, including Ohio and Arizona, to require work programs and monthly premiums for Medicaid, historically a free program for those eligible.  â€œEvery state is watching this to see what happens,â€?said Bevin of Kentuckyâ€™s waiver. â€œItâ€™s the first one in the queue.â€?The odds look good for Kentucky to get the waiver in the coming months, based on the track records of health officials that Trump named after his inauguration.  Seema Verma, the new head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which approves Medicaid waivers, said during congressional testimony that the agency will usher in â€œa new era of state flexibility and leadership.â€? Verma helped craft Kentuckyâ€™s waiver, but said she will recuse herself from the approval process to avoid conflicts of interest.  She and Tom Price wrote a letter to governors in March encouraging Medicaid reforms that more closely resemble commercial insurance plans. In the letter, they suggested features such as premium fees, health savings accounts, and emergency room co-payments that encourage the use of primary care.  CMS declined to comment on Kentuckyâ€™s waiver and said it does not speculate on the process while ongoing. Under federal law, waivers must promote Medicaidâ€™s objective of delivering healthcare services to vulnerable populations who cannot otherwise afford them.  â€œWaivers have never been used to cut people from the rolls,â€?said Emily Parento, associate professor at the University of the Pacificâ€™s law school and the former executive director of Kentuckyâ€™s Office of Health Policy. But Vermaâ€™s office is encouraging changes to Medicaid that make the government program look more like private insurance policies - goals that are similar to Bevinâ€™s in Kentucky. â€œI think what will happen is that other states will look at it and go, â€˜We want everything they got,â€™â€?Bevin said.

0449,Exclusive: Trump counterterrorism strategy urges allies to do more,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A draft of President Donald Trumpâ€™s new counterterrorism strategy demands that U.S. allies shoulder more of the burden in combating Islamist militants, while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated. The 11-page draft, seen on Friday by Reuters, said the United States should avoid costly, â€œopen-endedâ€?military commitments. â€œWe need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of American â€˜blood and treasureâ€?in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals,â€?states the document, which is expected to be released in coming months. â€œWe will seek to avoid costly, large-scale U.S. military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups,â€?it says. However, it acknowledges that terrorism â€œcannot be defeated with any sort of finality.â€?Michael Anton, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said, â€œAs part of its overall approach, the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire U.S.  national security strategy, to include the counterterrorism mission - which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011.â€?The process is aimed at ensuring â€œthe new strategy is directed against the pre-eminent terrorist threats to our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and allies,â€?Anton said. â€œMoreover, this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals, and guiding principles.â€?Combating Islamic extremism was a major issue for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The draft strategy paper,  which officials said was still being fine-tuned at the White House, describes the threat from Islamic militant groups in stark tones.      It remains to be seen how Trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Rather than scale back U.S. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former Obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the Pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like Yemen and Somalia. Trump may soon reverse years of Obama-ordered drawdowns in Afghanistan. His administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400-strong U.S. contingent helping Afghan forces fight a resurgent Taliban, current and former U.S. officials say. A senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria under Trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.  â€œIf you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy,â€?said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The increased pace of U.S. military operations has seen a recent spate of American casualties. The latest came in Somalia, where a Navy SEAL died and two others were wounded in an attack by al Shabaab militants, U.S. officials said on Friday. Since President Barack Obama released the last U.S. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of Islamic State, the threat has â€œdiversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago,â€?the draft strategy said. In addition to Islamic State, the United States and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al Qaeda, groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center for Security Studies and who reviewed the document at Reutersâ€?request, said the draft strategy â€œpaints - and I think accurately - a more dire pictureâ€?of the threat than the Obama document, which sounded a â€œtriumphalistâ€?tone following al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladenâ€™s death in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. The senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat Islamic State that Trump also has ordered.  The draft strategy seen by Reuters appears to flow from Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden-sharing by allies and alliances such as NATO. It does not include a signature phrase from Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign, â€œradical Islamic terrorism.â€?Instead, it says that jihadist groups â€œhave merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational Islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale.â€?The draftâ€™s first guiding principle is that the United States â€œwill always act to disrupt, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and our allies. This includes taking direct and unilateral action, if necessary.â€?The administration would boost U.S. homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders, â€œideologues, technical experts, financiers, external operators and battlefield commanders.â€?The draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and â€œdegrade their efforts to develop and deployâ€?chemical and biological weapons. Yet it provides few details on how the United States, which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries, many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities. The draft makes little mention of promoting human rights, development, good governance and other â€œsoft powerâ€?tools that Washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism. In contrast, the Obama counterterrorism strategy made â€œrespecting human rights, fostering good governance, respecting privacy and civil liberties, committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of lawâ€?the foremost of its guiding principles. â€œSoft power has a role to play, but not to the exclusion of kinetics,â€?or military action, said Hoffman. He called the draft â€œa very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1

0451,Trump travel ban back in U.S. courts next week as battles stretch on,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Legal challenges to President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries heat up again next week when two U.S. appeals courts consider whether it is constitutional. The legal fights may end up at the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps in the fall, many months after Trump first issued an executive order in January saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the United States for 90 days while officials reviewed the visa process.          Trump dropped the original travel order after unfavorable legal rulings and replaced it with a more limited ban which is itself now being challenged in appeals courts on two coasts. Arguing that the United States needed to tighten national security measures, Trumpâ€™s attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office. The fate of the ban is one indication of whether the Republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security. Omar Jadwat, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, who will be arguing the case at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia on Monday, said the fact that so much time has passed since the ban was issued is proof that there was no pressing national security need for it in the first place. The court fight will give those challenging the order an opportunity to argue that the government never intended for the travel pause to be temporary, said Buzz Frahn, an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in Palo Alto, California whose firm has been closely tracking the ongoing litigation.  Now almost 100 days after the original travel ban, the government says the period of 90 days was reset when the administration issued the new order in March. The Department of Homeland Security â€œis, and will be, continuously examining ways to enhance the screening and vetting process to shut down terrorist and criminal pathways into the United States,â€?agency spokesman David Lapan said. â€œSome improvements will be classified, others will be public, but the Department has only just begun ways to enhance the security of our immigration system,â€?he said in an email. Opponents - including states and civil rights groups - say that both the first ban and the revised ban, which also put a halt to all refugee admissions to the country for four months, discriminates against Muslims.  The government argues the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks.      The 4th Circuit will decide the fate of a ruling from a Maryland district judge that struck down a section of the revised executive order barring visitors from Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia.  The hearing will take place before 14 full-time judges of the appellate court. Ten of them were appointed by Democrats, and four by Republicans.  Then, on March 15, a three-judge panel at the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will review a decision from a Hawaii judge that halted not just the travel portion of the ban but also the section that barred refugees. The judges â€?who will sit on a panel in Seattle - have been assigned but their identities have not been made public. The 9th Circuit blocked Trumpâ€™s first ban in February, in a unanimous vote by one Republican-appointed judge and two-Democratic appointees. Trump lashed out at the ruling on Twitter and said he is ready for a fight at the Supreme Court. The nationâ€™s highest court is more likely to hear a case if the federal appeals courts reach opposite rulings or if the issue is of great national importance, according to legal experts.       But the Supreme Courtâ€™s session ends in June, and if it take the case it would probably not be heard until after the justices return in October.  ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1
0452,Trump's pick for Army secretary drops out: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for Army secretary, Mark Green, withdrew his name from consideration for the position, a White House official said on Friday. Green, who is the third Trump nominee for a service secretary position to withdraw, has faced criticism from rights groups and lawmakers over allegations about past comments regarding minorities as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, people.  In a statement, Green said â€œfalse and misleading attacksâ€?had driven him to withdraw. â€œTragically, my life of public service and my Christian beliefs have been mischaracterized and attacked by a few on the other side of the aisle for political gain,â€?he said. â€œWhile these false attacks have no bearing on the needs of the Army or my qualifications to serve, I believe it is critical to give the President the ability to move forward with his vision to restore our military to its rightful place in the world.â€?U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that Greenâ€™s decision to stand down was â€œgood news for all Americans.â€?It was especially good for those â€œwho were personally vilified byÂ his disparaging comments directed toward the LGBTQ community, Muslim community, Latino community and more,â€?Schumer said. Green served in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment where he made three combat tours to the Middle East. ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1
0453,Pentagon to lease privately owned Trump Tower apartment for nuclear 'football': letter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department is finalizing a lease on a privately owned apartment in New Yorkâ€™s Trump Tower for the White House Military Office to use for supporting President Donald Trump without providing any benefit to Trump or his organization, according to a Pentagon letter seen by Reuters. The Military Office carries and safeguards the â€œfootball,â€?the device that contains the top secret launch codes the president needs to order a nuclear attack, as well as providing him secure communications wherever he is. The White House, Secret Service, and Defense Department had no comment on whether similar arrangements have been made at other properties Trump frequents - Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump is spending this weekend.     In a letter to Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the House Armed Services and intelligence committees, Defense Department official James MacStravic, said the apartment is â€œprivately owned and ... lease negotiations have been with the ownerâ€™s representatives only.â€?MacStravic, who wrote that he was â€œtemporarily performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics,â€?said any acquisition of leased space with â€œan annual rental in excess of $1 million must first be approved by my office.â€?He â€œapproved this actionâ€?after consulting with the White House Military Office and other officials, he said. Officials declined to reveal the cost of the lease or identify the owners of the apartment.      MacStravicâ€™s letter, dated March 3, added: â€œWe are not aware of any means through which the President would personally benefit from a Government lease of this space.â€? The letter explained that the White House Military Office, a Pentagon unit, â€œrequested approval to lease space in the Trump Tower for personnel assigned to support the President when at his private residence.â€?The letter said such arrangements are â€œtypical of support providedâ€?by the Military Office to previous U.S. presidents and vice presidents at their private residences. It is not clear, however, whether the office has ever paid to rent space to house the classified equipment presidents need when they are staying at homes they own outside Washington. A White House spokeswoman said the White House had no information on the leasing issue. The Defense Department and U.S. Secret Service declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not reply to an email requesting comment.  When the Pentagon in February first acknowledged that it was seeking to lease space in Trump Tower, some Democrats questioned whether such a move would produce a financial windfall for Trump. â€œI am concerned by the appearance that the President of the United States will financially benefit from this deal at the expense of the Department of Defense - and ultimately, taxpayers,â€?Speier wrote to Defense Secretary James Mattis shortly after the Trump Tower issue became public in February.  By negotiating only with representatives of the owners of a private apartment, the Pentagon said it was seeking to avoid such concerns. ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1
0454,Trump does not think U.S. should copy Australia's health system: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump was simply saying nice things to an ally when he called Australiaâ€™s universal healthcare system better than the U.S. system, and he does not think his country should adopt a similar approach, the White House said on Friday. â€œThe president was complimenting a foreign leader on the operations of their healthcare system,â€?White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a news briefing. â€œIt didnâ€™t mean anything more than that.â€?Trump raised eyebrows when he told Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Thursday in New York, â€œYou have better health care than we do.â€?Trump spoke shortly after he led a White House rally with Republicans from the House of Representatives, who had just passed legislation to overturn much of former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law and move further away from a guarantee of universal coverage. That measure, opposed by Democrats, must clear the Senate before Trump can sign it into law. â€œOf course the Australians have better healthcare than we do - everybody does,â€?Trump tweeted on Friday. â€œObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.â€?Independent scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office have not yet analyzed the bill, but they estimated an earlier version would have led to 24 million fewer Americans with insurance coverage than under current law. Australiaâ€™s government plays a larger role in its health system. The country provides free hospital treatment and subsidized medical care for all residents through a publicly funded program. Roughly half of Australians choose to buy private coverage, which provides them with greater choices. Huckabee Sanders said Trumpâ€™s remarks do not mean he thinks the United States should adopt a similar system. â€œI think he believes that they have a good healthcare system for Australia,â€?she said. â€œWhat works in Australia may not work in the United States.â€?(This version of the story in third paragraph, corrects name of Australian prime minister) ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1
0455,Planned Parenthood protests aimed at House Republicans' offices,"(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood, the U.S. medical services provider that could lose federal funding under the Republican-controlled House of Representativesâ€?healthcare overhaul bill, said it would hold dozens of demonstrations outside the local offices of members of Congress across the country on Friday and Saturday. The protests will target some of the 217 Republican representatives who voted to pass legislation on Thursday that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the healthcare law passed in 2010 under former President Barack Obama. â€œWeâ€™re standing together as women, people of color, immigrants, and as people of faith, and weâ€™re fighting back to make sure that every single politician in America knows that we will not stand for â€˜defundingâ€?Planned Parenthood,â€?Kelly Robinson, the national organizing director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.  The bill still needs approval by the U.S. Senate. President Donald Trump, a Republican, praised the billâ€™s passage in the House but acknowledged that some of its provisions may change before it becomes law. A part of the Republicansâ€?proposed American Health Care Act would prevent Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed for any of its services, including cancer screening and pre-natal care, through the Medicaid program for the poor. About 60 percent of the patients who use Planned Parenthoodâ€™s 600 or so clinics are on Medicaid or other federal public health programs. Republican congressional offices from coast to coast were targeted on Friday, with protests planned at the offices of Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen in Morristown, New Jersey, Kevin Yoderice in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, and Darrell Issa in Vista, California, among others. Many Republicans oppose any funding for Planned Parenthood, citing religious grounds, because its services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law. The Family Research Council, a Christian advocacy group, and other conservative policy groups praised the House bill as a tool to help limit access to abortions. Planned Parenthood says the bill would harm 2.5 million people who rely on it for basic health services. ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1

0457,U.S. House approves tighter North Korea sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation on Thursday to tighten sanctions on North Korea by targeting its shipping industry and companies that do business with the reclusive state. The vote was 419 to 1. Supporters said the legislation was intended to send a strong message to North Korea, amid international concern over the escalation of its nuclear program. The measure would have to be approved by the Senate before it could be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law. Although legislation addressing North Korea has been introduced in the Senate, there was no immediate word on when or if the Senate might take up a bill. Any new U.S. sanctions against North Korea would likely affect China, the Northâ€™s most important trade partner. While China has been angered by North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile tests, it has signed up for increasingly tough U.N. sanctions against it, and says it is committed to enforcing them. Asked about the latest U.S. legislation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China opposed other countries using their own domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions.  With the situation tense on the Korean Peninsula, all sides need to exercise restraint and not irritate each other to avoid the situation worsening, he said.   ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0458,"With Obamacare vote, House Republicans free to turn to tax reform","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives plans to turn to tax reform in earnest, after concluding a lengthy healthcare debate this week with a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.  But even as Republicans predicted that tax reform would succeed before year-end, lawmakers encountered new uncertainties about what a final tax package might contain, as well as doubts about whether Republicans will be able to enact reforms without Democratic help. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have pledged to complete the biggest tax reform since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan was in office, before the end of 2017. But they face an uphill battle, mainly over policy differences within their own ranks.  Thursdayâ€™s 217-213 House vote on healthcare legislation raised confidence in the Republican-controlled chamberâ€™s ability to move major legislation after two earlier pushes ended in failure. But to move forward on tax reform, the House, Senate and Trump administration must agree on where to set tax rates, how to pay for cuts and whether the final package should add to the deficit or pay for itself, all areas where common ground may be hard to find. A plan to enact reforms without Democratic support will also require Republicans to pass a 2018 budget authorizing the parliamentary process known as reconciliation. But a new budget agreement poses a daunting task given Republican opposition to Trump demands for deep domestic spending cuts.   â€œThat may prove to be one, if not the most difficult votes of the tax reform process,â€?Jonathan Traub, a managing principal at the consulting firm Deloitte Tax LLP.   Meanwhile, the need to reach agreement between the House, Senate and White House will likely delay introduction of a tax reform bill, which had been expected in early June.  But Republicans say it will ultimately make it easier to enact reforms before the end of the year.  The House Ways and Means Committee, which will unveil the initial tax bill, is still aiming for a revenue-neutral package that raises $2.4 trillion for tax cuts through a new border adjustment tax and elimination of business deductions for net interest payments, both controversial measures. Panel chairman Kevin Brady told reporters that revenue neutrality is necessary to ensure bold, permanent changes to tax policy that can drive economic growth.   â€œThatâ€™s the argument and the case weâ€™re going to make to the Senate and the Trump administration,â€?he said. But Representative Mark Meadows, who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus that helped block Trumpâ€™s first healthcare bill,  voiced opposition to a revenue neutral approach. â€œIf itâ€™s revenue neutral, youâ€™re not really lowering taxes. Youâ€™re shifting the burden,â€?Meadows told reporters.       The Trump tax plan unveiled last week calls for steep tax cuts financed by government revenues that officials say will result from higher growth. Some fear the plan could add trillions of dollars to the deficit if growth does not materialize. Meadows said tax cuts should be offset by cuts to entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has promised not to touch. ",politicsNews,2017/5/5,1
0459,"Trump, Australia's Turnbull move to clear air after tense phone call","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump held his first-face-to-face meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Thursday, and declared that they â€œget along great,â€?following an acrimonious phone call in January that strained ties between the two allies.     â€œThey said we had a rough phone call. We didnâ€™t really have a rough phone call,â€?Trump said in dinner remarks. â€œIt got a little bit testy. But thatâ€™s okay.â€?Dressed in tuxedos as they prepared to attend a dinner, the two leaders met on board the USS Intrepid, a World War Two aircraft carrier that is now a museum moored on Manhattanâ€™s West Side. Joined by their wives, the two leaders later attended a gala to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Turnbull was one of the first foreign leaders Trump spoke to after taking office on Jan. 20. The Republican president became irritated that he was expected to honor an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centers on remote Pacific islands. Trump had broken off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes and later tweeted that the refugee agreement was a â€œdumb dealâ€?and vowed to study it. The call aroused criticism and raised questions about his diplomatic skills. Vice President Mike Pence visited Australia in April and made clear that while Trump was not happy about the refugee agreement, the United States would honor it out of respect for Australia. Under the agreement, Australia is to resettle refugees from three Central American countries. Thursdayâ€™s get-together with Turnbull was delayed because of Trumpâ€™s hastily arranged White House celebration with Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives after they narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The measure has yet to come before the Senate/    Trump and Turnbull were all smiles as they answered questions about the January phone call and the refugee deal during a picture-taking session. â€œWe get along great.Â We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, IÂ always have,â€?Trump said. Turnbull added: â€œWe can put the refugee deal behind you and move on.â€?Trump said the refugee deal had been â€œworked out for a long timeâ€?and that reporters had exaggerated the phone call. â€œWe had a great call,â€?he said, adding, â€œI mean, weâ€™re not babies.â€?â€œYoung at heart,â€?added Turnbull. Trump vowed to visit Australia as president, calling it â€œone of the great, great placesâ€?and noted he had many friends there. One such friend, pro golfer Greg Norman, was among the attendees at the Intrepid dinner. In dinner remarks after their meeting, Turnbull celebrated the unity of spirit that brought the two countries together against Japan in World War Two, and said Australia and the United States are united against North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs and are fighting together in Afghanistan. â€œToday and together, we condemn and we resist North Koreaâ€™s provocation,â€?he said. It was Trumpâ€™s first trip back to New York, his home and where he made his name and fortune, since the former real estate executive moved into the White House in January. His motorcade passed hundreds of protesters as it arrived at the Intrepid in the early evening. Trump did not plan to visit Trump Tower, his home in midtown Manhattan where his wife, first lady Melania Trump, and their young son Barron still live, but instead was to spend the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.

0460,Trump order frees tax-exempt churches to be more politically active,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that allows tax-exempt churches to more actively participate in politics and could free religious organizations to deny employees insurance coverage for birth-control pills. The order partially fulfills an oft-repeated campaign promise by Trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 run for the White House, although he would need an act of Congress to rescind the underlying law that he has opposed, known as the Johnson Amendment. The order was widely praised by religious organizations that either felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it, but others denounced it as putting womenâ€™s health in jeopardy or weakening the U.S. tradition of separating church and state. â€œWe will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more,â€?Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House where religious leaders had gathered in support. â€œNo one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors,â€?he said. Trumpâ€™s order directs the Internal Revenue Service to â€œalleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment,â€?the White House said in reference to a 1954 law sponsored by Lyndon Johnson, then a Texas senator who later became president. Under that amendment, the tax code prohibits organizations that enjoy tax-free status from participating in a political campaign or supporting any one candidate for elective office. The order also asks the government to issue rules that would allow religious groups such as the Little Sister of the Poor to deny their employees insurance coverage for services that they oppose on religious grounds, such as birth-control pills. Those employees would be forced to go outside their employer-provided insurance plan for subsidized contraceptives, said Lori Windham, a lawyer who represents the group. â€œTodayâ€™s announcement is a great day for the Little Sisters,â€?Windham said. The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it falls way short of meeting Trumpâ€™s pledge to â€œtotally destroyâ€?the Johnson Amendment. At least one expert said Trumpâ€™s order appears legally sound. Rolling back the Johnson Amendment does not favor any particular religious views over others, and the president has broad authority to decide not to enforce certain laws, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law.

0461,Trump's religious freedom order may give opponents an unintended boost,"BOSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order on Thursday making it easier for churches to dabble in politics kept faith with his promise to evangelical Christians who helped him win the White House, but could end up benefiting his opponents as well. Leaders of the U.S. religious left, a rising force of opposition to Trumpâ€™s hard-line stance on immigration and healthcare, said they were poised to benefit from the move, which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax-exempt status if they advocate for particular candidates. â€œThis is going to backfire on Trump,â€?said the Rev. Jennifer Butler, chief executive of progressive policy group Faith in Public Life. â€œWe are morally outraged at what is going on and we are appalled at the weaponization of religion.â€?The group plans to mobilize voters who view some of Trumpâ€™s policies as immoral. While the group does not endorse candidates, those voters in the 2018 midterm elections would back candidates who oppose those policies. Trumpâ€™s order gives religious groups more liberty to do so without jeopardizing tax-exempt status. â€œWeâ€™re going to be mobilizing millions of voters to turn out at the polls and vote their values,â€?Butler said.  Sojourners, a Washington-based progressive Christian network that advocates for immigrants and the poor, also believes more of its members will now feel free to speak out against Trumpâ€™s policies. â€œI wouldnâ€™t tell people who to vote for but I would tell them what to vote against and this might encourage more churches to speak out against him,â€?said Jim Wallis, the groupâ€™s founder. â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s use of racism and racial bigotry is unchristian. His attack on refugees is anti-Christian.â€?Trump has repeatedly and angrily denied allegations that his policies are racist, calling immigration limits essential for national security. Before signing the order, the Republican president cited historically black churches and slain civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as drivers of U.S. social progress. Evangelical and Roman Catholic leaders as well as a prominent U.S. rabbi joined Trump when he signed the order instructing the Internal Revenue Service to â€œalleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment,â€?the 1954 law prohibiting organizations with tax-free status, including churches, from participating in political campaigns or supporting particular candidates. The move by Trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 presidential run, was widely praised by religious organizations that felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it. â€œWe will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more,â€?Trump, who criticized the Johnson Amendment during his campaign, said at the ceremony. Rescinding the law would require an act of Congress. Ralph Reed, a longtime leader of the religious right and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, praised Trumpâ€™s executive order in a statement, saying it removed a â€œsword of Damocles that has hung over the faith community for decades.â€?Several prominent leaders of the religious left noted that neither Republican nor Democratic policy stances lined up neatly with any major religionâ€™s teaching and said the move could fracture congregations by encouraging leaders to take sides. â€œOnce faith leaders become partisan, it hijacks their moral authority and their impartiality in this hyper-partisan environment,â€?said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order, but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it fell far short of meeting Trumpâ€™s pledge to â€œtotally destroyâ€?the Johnson Amendment. Several leaders interviewed said they worried that Trumpâ€™s move could be unevenly enforced, allowing conservative Christian churches to promote political candidates without extending the same exemptions to other views or other denominations. â€œThe biggest religious liberty issue now for me is how Christians are going to protect the liberty of Muslims,â€?said Wallis, of Sojourners. â€œThatâ€™s the top issue, more than whether they have to hire gay people.â€?Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group would keep urging U.S. imams to speak out on moral issues with political consequences, but would urge them to remain nonpartisan. He wondered if all religious leaders would follow that guidance. â€œThese kind of moves, particularly by this administration, have a vast ocean of unintended consequences,â€?he said.

0462,"Tillerson urges ASEAN to cut North Korea funding, minimize ties","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Southeast Asian foreign ministers on Thursday to do more to help cut funding streams for North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs and to minimize diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. In his first ministerial meeting with all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Tillerson also called on nations with competing claims in the South China Sea to cease all island building and militarization while talks aimed at creating a maritime code of conduct were under way. Patrick Murphy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Tillerson stressed Washingtonâ€™s security and economic commitment to the region, amid doubts raised by President Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?platform and withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Tillerson called on ASEAN countries to fully implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, and to show a united front on the issue, Murphy said. â€œWe think that more can be done, not just in Southeast Asia,â€?he told reporters. â€œWe are encouraging continued and further steps across all of ASEAN.â€? Last week, Tillerson called on all countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, saying that North Korea abuses diplomatic privileges to help fund its arms programs. Tillerson also warned that Washington would sanction foreign firms and people conducting business with North Korea if countries did not act themselves. All ASEAN members have diplomatic relations with North Korea and five have embassies there. Murphy said Washington was not encouraging ASEAN states to formally cut ties, but to examine the North Korean presence â€œwhere it clearly exceeds diplomatic needs.â€?He said some countries were already doing this and also looking at the presence of North Korean workers, another significant revenue earner for Pyongyang. Some officials of ASEAN members, speaking to reporters, acknowledged concerns about North Korea, but also cited concerns about trade relations with the United States. Philippine acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, whose country currently chairs ASEAN, said of the U.S. call to minimize relations with Pyongyahng, â€œWe havenâ€™t really discussed that among the ASEAN countries, so thatâ€™s probably something we will look at. â€œOur immediate concern is to try and ensure the tension on the peninsula doesnâ€™t increase. ... The last thing we would like to see is to have a conflict break out due to some miscalculation,â€?Manalo said. Singaporeâ€™s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said sanctions would have to be fully implemented, but North Koreaâ€™s presence in his country is already minimal.Asked if that could be further reduced, he said: â€œI wonâ€™t say never, but at this point in time thatâ€™s not the issue - we will stick with the U.N. Security Councilâ€™s resolutions.â€?Balakrishnan, whose country signed the TPP, stressed the importance of U.S.-ASEAN business ties - annual trade of $100 billion supporting half a million U.S. jobs and $274 billion of U.S. investment. â€œSoutheast Asia is replete with economic opportunities and itâ€™s too big to miss out on,â€?he said. His remark highlighted growing concern in Asia that Trump has ditched former President Barack Obamaâ€™s economic â€œpivotâ€?to the region by abandoning the TPP, something analysts say has led to more countries being pulled into Chinaâ€™s orbit. Murphy said Tillerson stressed that ASEAN remained a â€œvery important ... strategic partner,â€?which is shown by Trumpâ€™s commitment to attend regional summits in the Philippines and Vietnam in November. Manalo called the meeting with Tillerson and Trumpâ€™s travel plans â€œencouragingâ€?signs. Washington wants ASEAN countries to crack down on money laundering and smuggling involving North Korea and to look at restricting legal business too. It has been working to persuade China, North Koreaâ€™s neighbor and only major ally, to increase pressure on Pyongyang. U.S. officials are also asking China to urge more China-friendly ASEAN members, such as Laos and Cambodia, to do the same. U.S. efforts have included a flurry of calls by Trump to the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. Diplomats say U.S. pressure has caused some irritation in  ASEAN, including Malaysia, which has maintained relations with Pyongyang in spite of the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Unâ€™s estranged half brother at Kuala Lumpur International airport in February/         On the issue of the South China Sea, ASEAN has adopted a cautious approach recently, with a weekend summit avoiding references to Chinaâ€™s building and arming of artificial islands there. This stance coincided with moves by China and ASEAN to draft a framework to negotiate a code of conduct. Murphy said Tillerson had stressed that this process needed â€œroom and spaceâ€?through avoiding fortifying existing claims. The United States has conducted freedom of navigation operations to challenge South China Sea claims, angering China, but not yet under Trump. Murphy said such operations would continue, but declined to say when the next might occur. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0463,New York protesters greet Trump on first visit home,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump returned to his hometown on Thursday for the first time since taking office, as many New Yorkers took to the streets to protest the politics of the man who built his name and fortune in the city. The presidential motorcade passed hundreds of demonstrators as it arrived at the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid in the early evening for a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull hours after it was originally scheduled.  Before leaving Washington, Trump held a hastily arranged White House celebration with fellow Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives who narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. [nL1N1I61UA] If anything, Trumpâ€™s role in efforts to scrap the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, further incensed the protesters. Among those on the street were members of the New York State Nurses Association, who chanted: â€œWhat do we want? Health care! When do we want it? Now!â€? Demonstrators from the Working Families Party spent much of the afternoon rallying and marching near the Intrepid, now a floating museum on Manhattanâ€™s West Side, banging pans, chanting: â€œNot my presidentâ€?and carrying signs including one that read: â€œThis village doesnâ€™t want its idiot back!â€?Rob Adkins, 33, a professional musician from Brooklyn who is insured through Obamacare, said he was alarmed by the Trump-backed Republican healthcare plan that passed the House. â€œIt could cost me my health insurance,â€?he said, echoing the sentiments of several other protesters. The demonstrations, which included other groups throughout Manhattan, were reminiscent of the weeks after Trumpâ€™s Nov. 8 election when frequent protests took place outside his home in the Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name.    The first 100 days since the Jan. 20 inauguration of the businessman-turned-politician brought rollbacks of environmental regulations and crackdowns on immigrants, none of which play well in the liberal Northeast city. Fewer than one in five residents in the United Statesâ€?most populous city voted for Trump, even though he comes from its Queens borough, built a real estate brand and other ventures associated with New York, and has been fodder for its tabloid newspapers for decades. Providing security for first lady Melania Trump, who has continued to live in Trump Tower while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes the school year, has been a costly obligation for New York.  After security costs for Trump and his family of about $24 million during the transition and $300,000 a day since then, Congress voted last week to reimburse the city and other local governments for $61 million. Following the events with Turnbull, which include a black-tie dinner on the Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of World War Twoâ€™s Battle of the Coral Sea, Trump was expected to go to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the weekend.

0464,"House Republicans repeal Obamacare, hurdles await in U.S. Senate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal Obamacare, handing Republican President Donald Trump a victory that could prove short-lived as the healthcare legislation heads into a likely tough battle in the Senate. The vote to repeal former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature domestic achievement, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance, was Trumpâ€™s biggest legislative win since he took office in January, putting him on a path to fulfilling one of his key campaign promises as well as a seven-year quest by Republican lawmakers. It marked a reversal of fortune for the Republican president who suffered a stunning defeat in late March when House Republican leaders pulled legislation to scrap Obamacare after they and the White House could not resolve the clashing interests of Republican moderates and the partyâ€™s most conservative lawmakers. Trump has called Obamacare a â€œdisasterâ€?and congressional Republicans have long targeted the 2010 law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, calling it government overreach. But despite holding the White House and controlling both houses of Congress, Republicans have found overturning Obamacare politically perilous, partly because of voter fears, loudly expressed at constituentsâ€?town-hall meetings, that many people would lose their health insurance as a result.     With Thursdayâ€™s 217-213 vote, Republicans obtained just enough support to push the legislation through the House, sending it to the Senate for consideration. No Democratic House members voted for the bill. Democrats say it would make insurance unaffordable for those who need it most and leave millions more uninsured. They accuse Republicans of seeking tax cuts for the rich, partly paid for by cutting health benefits. The legislation, called the American Health Care Act, is by no means a sure thing in the Senate, where the Republicans hold a slender 52-48 majority in the 100-seat chamber and where only a few Republican defections could sink it. As Republicans crossed over the vote threshold to pass the bill, Democrats in the House began singing â€œNa na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye,â€?a rowdy suggestion that Republicans will lose seats in the 2018 congressional elections because of their vote. Within an hour of the vote, Trump celebrated with House lawmakers in the White House Rose Garden. â€œI went through two years of campaigning and Iâ€™m telling you, no matter where I went, people were suffering so badly with the ravages of Obamacare,â€?Trump said. â€œWe are going to get this passed through the Senate. I am so confident.â€?PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS The treatment of people with â€œpre-existingâ€?conditions was one of the central issues in the House debate on the bill and is sure to resurface in the Senate. Obamacare prevented insurers from charging those with pre-existing conditions higher rates, a common practice before its implementation. It also required them to cover 10 essential health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs. The Republican bill passed on Thursday would allow states to opt out of those provisions. While insurers could not deny people insurance because of pre-existing conditions, they would be allowed to charge them as much as they want. In an analysis released on Thursday, healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said the Republican bill would cover only 5 percent of enrollees with pre-existing conditions in the individual insurance markets. Republicans have argued that their bill would give people more choice and reduce the role of government. In a push to pass the bill before members leave on Friday for a week in their home districts, the House voted before the bill was assessed by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which estimates its cost and effect on insurance rolls. Republicans have said the bill will be scored by the CBO and other fixes will be made before the Senate votes. Health insurers, such as Anthem Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Cigna Corp, have faced months of uncertainty over healthcareâ€™s future. So have hospital companies, such as HCA Holdings Inc and Tenet Healthcare Corp. Obamacare expanded Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, provided income-based tax credits to help the poor buy insurance on individual insurance markets set up by the law, and required everyone to buy insurance or pay a penalty. The Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, which paid for the law, roll back the Medicaid expansion and slash the programâ€™s funding, repeal the penalty for not purchasing insurance and replace the lawâ€™s tax credits with flat age-based credits. In a sign of the challenges ahead for the legislation, nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association, and the AARP advocacy group for older Americans, strongly opposed the Republican bill. Many said last-minute amendments further eroded protection for the most vulnerable groups, including the sick and elderly. â€œIâ€™ve already made clear that I donâ€™t support the House bill as currently constructed because I continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect Ohioâ€™s Medicaid expansion population,â€?said Republican Senator Rob Portman.   While the billâ€™s fate in the Senate is uncertain, its House passage could boost Trumpâ€™s hopes of pushing through other big-ticket items on his agenda, such as tax reform. The previous failure to overhaul healthcare legislation had raised questions about how much Republicans could work together to help Trump fulfill his campaign pledges. â€œAnything that they (the Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together,â€?said Randy Frederick, vice president trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. â€œThis puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because itâ€™s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together,â€?he added.

0465,"Factbox: Republicans' Obamacare rollback would dump Medicaid expansion, taxes","(Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010.  Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill had collapsed in confusion, but Republicans overcame their differences in a 217-213 vote that will send the bill to the Senate, where its outlook was uncertain. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. An early estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers of the impact of the Republican rollback bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, said it would leave 24 million more Americans without insurance coverage by 2026. Here are the billâ€™s main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacareâ€™s most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parentsâ€?health plan until age 26. The bill would let states opt out of Obamacareâ€™s mandate that insurers charge the same rates on sick and healthy people. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacareâ€™s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug costs.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill also would provide $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for insurance. It would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won a provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more.  The bill would end in 2018 Obamacareâ€™s income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacareâ€™s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as â€œCadillacâ€?plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until Jan. 1, 2020. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0466,"Families of San Bernardino shooting sue Facebook, Google, Twitter","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided â€œmaterial supportâ€?to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. â€œFor years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,â€?family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. â€œWithout defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,â€?the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farookâ€™s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police.  In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the   nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit.  Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

0467,"Softening his approach, Trump helps seal a healthcare deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, on his third try at overhauling Obamacare, sent no tweets attacking fellow Republicans, set no  deadlines and issued no public ultimatums. Lawmakers who met with him said he spoke with them, not at them. Some lawmakers and aides in the U.S. House of Representatives were hesitant to credit Trump or his softer approach with Thursdayâ€™s 217-213 vote rolling back President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature 2010 healthcare overhaul. Several aides emphasized the role of House Republican leaders and Vice President Mike Pence in bridging differences between the partyâ€™s moderates and hardline conservatives. Others said they saw a different Trump at work this week versus March 24, when he backed a bill that collapsed and again in April when his fellow Republicans failed a second time.  Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Thursday that in March the White House threatened to work against his re-election bid if he balked at supporting the healthcare bill. This time Trump, who took office in January, was â€œlargely absent,â€?Sanford said, adding: â€œThey got it clear that threats were not going to work with me.â€?In White House talks with Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, Trump helped to nail down critical moderate votes. A senior White House official said Trump worked the phones this time and realized it had been a mistake to set a deadline the first time. Trump spoke with Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading House Republican, during late-night calls. In conversations with lawmakers, Trump kept the focus on meeting a Republican promise from the 2016 election campaign to roll back a federal government healthcare law that they view as too costly and over-reaching. Any plan to overhaul Obamacare faces a tougher battle in the 100-member U.S. Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer majority. While Republicans control both the White House and Congress, senators are traditionally less easily moved by presidential pressure than members of the House. Democrats in both houses remained firmly opposed to a bill they said would deprive millions of Americans of healthcare coverage. â€œThe bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate,â€?said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS A KEY House Republicans joined an exuberant Trump for a victory lap in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. Turning to Ryan, Trump reminded him of the criticism the speaker faced when the healthcare bill stalled in the House the first time. â€œFor the last week, Iâ€™ve been hearing, â€˜Paul Ryan doesnâ€™t have it ... Then today, I heard Paul Ryan is a genius,â€™â€?Trump said. A key turning point came on Monday, when Upton and four other Republican lawmakers met to discuss how the rollback bill could be changed to better protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, a concern for Republican moderates. No amendment had been hammered out by Tuesday and Upton, an influential moderate, said he opposed the bill, as did Long, a close Trump ally. Trump called them both to the White House. At their meeting on Wednesday, Upton and Long reminded Trump of his promise in a weekend television interview that the Republican plan would protect people with pre-existing medical conditions. They pressed him to stand by that commitment and it worked. Trump endorsed their amendment to add some money to the Republican bill for that purpose.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had 15 to 20 meetings or calls with House Republicans ahead of the vote. She said the president was â€œdirectly engaged.â€?If Senate Republicans can pass a bill, a House-Senate panel of negotiators likely would have to iron out the differences and present a compromise version for both chambers to pass. â€œMy only concern is the U.S. Senate,â€?said Republican Representative Dave Brat, a Freedom Caucus member. â€œIf they come back with any big changes that will make life a little tough.â€?Brat said Trumpâ€™s role will be important. â€œThe new variable is President Trump. If he gets out there and puts a little heat on it,â€?then a Senate-House compromise is possible. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0468,U.S. House Intelligence Committee has 'successful' Russia hearing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of a House of Representatives probe of possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election said they had a â€œsuccessfulâ€?hearing on Thursday, projecting unity after a partisan division had threatened to derail their investigation. Representatives Mike Conaway, the new Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee probe, and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat, addressed reporters together after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified at a classified hearing. â€œWe had a very successful hearing,â€?Conaway said. Schiff said the witnesses had provided â€œsome additional insights,â€?and the committee was working together very well.  Neither responded to questions. The committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, recused himself from the investigation and was replaced by Conaway last month after a dispute caused Democrats to question whether Nunes could credibly lead a probe of possible Russian attempts to influence the election in favor of President Donald Trump. Russia denies the allegations. Nunes had infuriated Democrats by telling reporters, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump - before informing committee Democrats - that he had seen documents showing that the communications of Trump associates had been caught up in surveillance. It later emerged that Nunes, a close Trump ally, obtained the information at the White House, after the Republican president pushed back against suspicions that Russia boosted his campaign by making the unsubstantiated accusation that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower in New York. Schiff and Conaway later issued a joint statement on Thursdayâ€™s classified hearing saying they remained committed to working with the FBI as it continues its investigation. They said they are currently sending out invitations for witnesses to testify and requesting documents. They said they were looking forward to the next steps of the investigation, including an open hearing with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and John Brennan, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama. Nunes canceled that hearing when it was originally scheduled in late March, frustrating Democrats, but the committee has now promised it will take place at a still undetermined date. Yates and Clapper are due to testify in the Senate on Monday. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0469,U.S. Senate passes bill to fund government through September,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday gave final legislative approval to a $1.2 trillion spending bill to keep the government open through September, a measure President Donald Trump is expected to sign before Fridayâ€™s deadline.      Senators from both Republican and Democratic parties voted in favor of the bill, which passed 79 to 18 with only Republicans opposing the measure, citing minimal changes to spending levels.   The bill, which was passed 309-118 in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, now heads to Trump.  While it failed to include many of the items Trump had requested, he is expected to sign the bill before midnight Friday, when without his signature the government would shut down.  As soon as this spending measure is law, lawmakers and Trump must already begin looking forward to the next deadline on Oct. 1. Lawmakers are hopeful they can pass regular spending bills but the process is likely to be complicated by Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, a desire to rewrite the tax code and a need to find a deal to raise the debt ceiling since the limit is expected to be reached in the fall.  Under the compromise measure, the Pentagonâ€™s funding increased, a priority that had been laid out by Republicans and Trump. It also funded Democratic priorities, including health care subsidies.  â€œThis bill is far from perfect, but itâ€™s better than how we are spending our money today, better than how we were spending our money a year ago,â€?Republican Senator Roy Blunt said on the Senate floor.  Democrats also claimed victory in the passage of the legislation, arguing that it fails to fund Trumpâ€™s priorities including money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, the bill funds subsidies for health care coverage provided through the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature domestic legislation.  Republican Senator Ted Cruz gave his reasons for voting against the bill.  â€œWhile I am pleased to see increased funding for our men and women in uniform and their critical missions across the globe, this bill fails in a number of ways, including by continuing to fund sanctuary cities, Planned Parenthood, and Obamacare,â€?Cruz said.  Sanctuary cities are those that give limited cooperation to the federal government in enforcing immigration laws and Planned Parenthood is a conservative target because abortion is among the womenâ€™s health care services it provides. The spending bill does not include many of the spending cuts on domestic programs Trump had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Ricoâ€™s underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million for firefighting in Western states. The legislation adds $12.5 billion in defense spending. It makes $2.5 billion more available after Trump gives details on his plans for fighting the Islamic State militant group. The bill was approved months after the Oct. 1 2016 deadline to pass government funding for the fiscal year. For the past seven months, federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous yearâ€™s funding and the priorities that came with that. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0470,INSTANTVIEW: House Republicans pass revised Obamacare overhaul,"(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday to repeal major parts of Obamacare and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, handing President Donald Trump his biggest legislative victory but setting up a tough fight in the Senate. STEPHEN WOOD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, NEW YORK: â€œThis strikes to me that the market is breathing a sigh of relief more than a nod of approval. I think there will be progress on individual and corporate tax cuts but they will come at the end of 2017. This will be positive for the economy and markets. We think there will be â€˜knots in the flossâ€?to get legislation done. We expect to see more sloppiness in the legislative process so you have to focus on fundamentals. Valuation is currently very high in the equity space. The outlook for the United States is good, but we need very good fundamentals to justify current equity valuation. Europe is increasingly interesting from an equity perspective. One would be more comfortable with Europe compared with the U.S.â€?â€œElections have consequences, and I think that this is the very first manifestation of it. It would be foolish to say that it doesnâ€™t reinvigorate Trump because ... earlier this week the main headlines were that the budget was an Obama-type budget instead of anything that was promised during the campaign. â€œOnce Republicans develop cohesion you are going to see more of a domino effect. Itâ€™s like, â€˜We all got onboard with this (healthcare reform), whatâ€™s stopping us from trying to get money for the wall or having tax reform thatâ€™s going to be agreeable to the presidentâ€™s agenda?â€?So I think that it does in some way invigorate it.â€? GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, PHILADELPHIA: â€œWhat is a bit lost in the perception that Houseâ€™s healthcare reform bill is positive for financial markets is a proposed repeal of a surcharge of roughly 3.9 percent on investment income on high-income individuals, which is in the Affordable Care Act. Now this bill goes to the Senate. For the market, the odds of passage of at least this version of â€˜repeal-and-replaceâ€?in the Senate isnâ€™t very high. Itâ€™s going to a tough sell in the Senate. This is largely a non-event for the bond market. Itâ€™s more gearing up for tomorrowâ€™s jobs report and what Yellen might say.â€?RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS: â€œI think anything that they (Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together. Because obviously the biggest divisions are not between the Democrats and the Republicans but within the Republican party. â€œThis puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because itâ€™s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together.â€?JOSEPH KRIST, PARTNER, CREDIT SPECIALIST, COURT STREET GROUP RESEARCH, NEW YORK: Â Â Â  â€œIt means that it satisfies those members of Congress who have made this a primary campaign issue and want to say they want to repeal Obamacare and we voted to did it. From a policy standpoint it is virtually meaningless. The bill from everything I have seen is virtually impossible to pass in the Senate.â€?Â Â Â  â€œI donâ€™t think this really should have any impact. The fundamentals driving peopleâ€™s healthcare ideas came before the election. People looking at small standalone and rural hospitals, saw they were wall badly positioned for healthcare reform going forward, whether it be because of Obamacare, should it remain, due to cost reduction measures. And conversely people were looking at size as a really important factor, whether a large institution or large chains. The consolidation was already coming whether repealed or not. It is not really a big factor from a public finance fixed income perspective. You still want big balance sheets, large pools of cash and diversity revenues.â€? â€œThis morning going in the market was expecting the House was going to pass it and it did.â€?â€œThis is just one of several different things Trump is trying to get accomplished. This is out of the way and now they have to go to tax reform. Thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s going to drag out for a while and probably the next key thing, aside from the geopolitical things that are going on.â€? Â Â Â Â â€œAs far as traders and investors I talk to, this (healthcare bill) isnâ€™t affecting their position or what they want to do.â€? RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: â€œThe fact that they could pass this doesnâ€™t make much of a difference. The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it. â€œI donâ€™t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue. I think theyâ€™re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldnâ€™t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.  â€œBut the fact that they could pass the healthcare, even pass it in the House, and pass it so narrowly, I donâ€™t think it necessarily means the tax plan is more likely to come through.â€?KEN POLCARI, DIRECTOR OF THE NYSE FLOOR DIVISION, Oâ€™NEIL SECURITIES, NEW YORK: â€œIt passes the House, thatâ€™s fine, now it goes to the Senate, and we know in the Senate it is going to have a very tough time. So even though it has passed the one, it is certainly not a done deal yet. Obamacare is still very much alive and intact.  â€œThe market has really been flat. I donâ€™t necessarily think this is such a surprise, after all the news reports today and yesterday, people were expecting it. They are all high-fiving and cheering and all that stuff in the Congress but it still has to go to the Senate and that is where it is going to run into some problems.  â€œThe market is again biding time, there is no reason itâ€™s not really taking off, we are hitting our head at the ceiling, we have been hitting our head on the ceiling. If anything it is going to cause it, the catalyst is going to be the (French election) Sunday night.

President Donald Trump has yet to nominate the other two commissioners to help round out the five-member panel. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0472,White House says 'critical' that House passes healthcare bill Thursday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said it was â€œcriticalâ€?that the U.S. House of Representatives pass a Republican-sponsored healthcare bill on Thursday to repeal a law enacted under the administration of former President Barack Obama. â€œWith Obamacare on the verge of collapse, it is critical that the House passes the AHCA (healthcare bill) today and we continue to make progress toward repealing and replacing Obamacare,â€?White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing. The House was expected to hold a vote on repealing Obamacare later on Thursday, with Republicans predicting victory on overturning the healthcare law even though their seven-year drive could founder in the U.S. Senate.

0473,House banking panel passes bill to undo U.S. financial crisis rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House banking panel on Thursday passed a controversial bill that would drastically change how the U.S. government regulates the financial sector. With support only from the panelâ€™s Republicans, the bill approved by the House Financial Services Committee would eliminate significant parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and place new restrictions on regulators monitoring Wall Street. The odds of the bill offered by Representative Jeb Hensarling becoming law are long, given staunch opposition by  Democrats to many of its central proposals. The bill marks the new Congressâ€?first attempt to significantly roll back existing financial rules after Republicans made gains in the 2016 election. President Donald Trump has identified easing rules on banks as a key component of his economic agenda and effort to spur lending and grow the economy. Critics of the bill argue that it undoes many of the critical protections enacted following the financial crisis and puts the nation at greater risk of another meltdown. If made law, the bill would repeal regulatorsâ€?ability to step in and wind down failing financial institutions. It also would hamstring their ability to identify and more closely regulate firms they believe are critical to the health of the financial system. Under the bill, banks that agree to adopt a 10 percent capital ratio would be allowed to receive an exemption from many of Dodd-Frankâ€™s existing rules. It will also require regulators to get congressional approval on any major new rulemaking project, and overhaul the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The powers of that agency, created by Dodd-Frank, would be curtailed, limiting the steps it can take to punish wrongdoing by banks and subjecting it to a number of outside checks on its authority and funding. In addition, the bill significantly changes how the Federal Reserve operates, subjecting its monetary policy decision-making to a stricter rules-based process, while separating its economic policymaking from its financial regulatory work. Hensarling has said he expects the bill will be considered soon by the full House, where it likely would be passed by the Republican majority.  However, the Senate Banking Committee will be considering its own proposals to rework financial rules. More modest legislation coming from that committee is more likely to become law, given it will likely be designed to attract necessary support from Democrats. ",politicsNews,2017/5/4,1
0474,Trump spends more time than predecessors in White House bubble,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his first 100 days in office, Donald Trump made fewer appearances outside of the presidential bubble than his three immediate predecessors, venturing less beyond the White House or his private Mar-a-Lago estate, according to a Reuters review. The U.S. president cast himself during his election campaign last year as a Washington outsider and a populist champion, and often seemed most comfortable at raucous campaign rallies. Trump still constantly tells Americans what is on his mind through prolific use of Twitter messages, but he has not traveled out into the country often since taking office on Jan. 20.  Trump made comments at official appearances 132 times in the first 100 days, compared with 139 by Barack Obama in the same period, 177 by George W. Bush and 162 by Bill Clinton. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8M8EU) Some 22 of his appearances were in settings other than the White House, Air Force One, a government agency or at Mar-a-Lago, a Florida resort that his administration has called the â€œwinter White House.â€?That compares to 62 such appearances by Obama in his first 100 days, 80 for Bush and 46 for Clinton. Reuters reviewed public remarks delivered by the presidents using White House websites, pool reports and documents archived by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Trump made public comments on five separate occasions at Mar-a-Lago. None of the other three presidents spoke to the public from a personal residence during their first 100 days, although Bush spoke twice at Camp David, the rustic presidential retreat in Maryland.     Asked about his travel, Trumpâ€™s advisers say he is focused on implementing the promises he made at his campaign rallies. Â Â Â  â€œThere is obviously a premium on his time,â€?said White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom. â€œWe proceed with any additional travel very thoughtfully.â€?Â Â Â  Bradley Blakeman, who was deputy assistant for scheduling and appointments under Bush, said Trump may be missing out on opportunities to sell his message to the public.  â€œDeals are made in Washington on Pennsylvania Avenue, but they are sold on Main Street, USA,â€?Blakeman said. â€œItâ€™s an important part of the bully pulpit.â€?Â Â Â  He said Trump should do targeted events focused on specific legislative priorities that will get coverage by local news outlets, where stories on presidential visits tend to be more positive than in the national media. Â Â Â  During his first 100 days, Bush visited more than half a dozen schools in Washington and at least five different states as he promoted his education initiative, No Child Left Behind.  Â Â Â Â Trumpâ€™s first major legislative push has focused on reforming the U.S. healthcare system, but he has not yet delivered remarks at a medical facility. In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump lamented the confining nature of the presidency with its 24-hour Secret Service protection. â€œYouâ€™re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really canâ€™t go anywhere,â€?he said. Still, he remains a constant focus of public attention, helped by his use of Twitter, a tool that was seldom used or was entirely unavailable to his most recent three predecessors. â€œInteraction online does not completely replace the value of in-person appearances, but you canâ€™t ignore the fact that there is no limit on the amount of people the presidentâ€™s tweets can reach,â€?Strom said. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said that while Trumpâ€™s use of social media had opened a new chapter in presidential communication, his lack of sustained attention on any one issue undercut his message. Â Â Â  â€œThereâ€™s not a focus there. When a president is all over the map, then he loses his power,â€?Jacobs said. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1

0476,Trump order to ease ban on political activity by churches,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will take executive action on Thursday to ease a ban on political activity by churches and other tax-exempt institutions as part of an order on religious liberties, a senior White House official said on Wednesday. Trumpâ€™s executive order to mark the National Day of Prayer will also mandate regulatory relief to religious employers that object to contraception, such as Little Sisters of the Poor, the official said in a briefing. The order does not include provisions to allow government agencies and businesses to deny services to gay people in the name of religious freedom, as was feared by some civil liberties and gay rights groups. â€œThis executive order isnâ€™t about discrimination,â€?said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. â€œAnything currently illegal under current law would still be illegal.â€? â€œIt directs the IRS to exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the Johnson amendment which prohibits religious leaders from speaking about politics and candidate from the pulpit,â€?the official said. Trump frequently complained about the 1954 law known as the Johnson amendment during his campaign for the presidency, bolstering his support among religious conservatives who contend it violates free speech and religious freedom rights. Changing the law altogether would require action in the Republican-led U.S. Congress. â€œAnd it provides regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacareâ€™s burdensome preventive services mandate, which is a position supported by the Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby,â€?the official said. In the case of Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts retailer, the high court said certain employers could, on religious grounds, choose to not pay for employee contraception mandated under President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law. The Little Sisters of the Poor is a religious order that faced huge fines over its refusal to pay for contraception under Obamacare.    ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1

0479,U.S. needs to balance foreign alliances: Tillerson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday outlined for his staff how an â€œAmerica Firstâ€?agenda translates into foreign policy, but did not address the Trump administrationâ€™s proposed budget cuts, which worry many diplomats. It was the first time Tillerson had addressed all employees since his first day on the job on Feb. 2, when he spoke to hundreds of State Department officials in the buildingâ€™s lobby, and the most thorough explanation yet of the Trump administrationâ€™s approach to foreign policy. Some allies and even some U.S. officials have interpreted Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€?agenda, which puts Americansâ€?interests at home ahead of those of its partners overseas, as a threat to retreat from the world. Tillerson said U.S. foreign policy priorities had gotten â€œa little bit out of balanceâ€?in the previous decades, with the United States too focused on promoting economic activity and trade with emerging economies. â€œThese are really important relationships to us, and theyâ€™re really important alliances, but weâ€™ve got to bring them back into balance,â€?he said, speaking without notes and walking around the stage in a packed State Department auditorium. He also signaled that the United States would de-emphasize human rights concerns in some of its interactions with other countries, saying that while U.S. values remain constant, its policies can adapt. â€œIf we condition too heavily that others must adopt this value that weâ€™ve come to over a long history of our own, it really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests,â€?Tillerson said. Tillerson gave a tour of U.S. priorities around the world, including in East Asia, Russia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, omitting Europe. With regard to North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program, Tillerson said the administration is willing to use so-called secondary sanctions to target foreign companies that continue to do business with Pyongyang in contravention of United Nations sanctions. The pressure campaign on North Korea is â€œat about dial setting 5 or 6 right now,â€?Tillerson said. On China, Tillerson said the United States has a â€œtremendous opportunityâ€?to define its relationship with the superpower for the next several decades, and that he sensed great interest by the Chinese leadership to do that as well. He and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will chair a dialogue with their Chinese counterparts in June, in addition to a dialogue focused on economics and trade and led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Tillerson said he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow last month that U.S.-Russia relations were at their lowest point since the Cold War.  â€œHe did not disagree,â€?Tillerson said. â€œHe shrugged his shoulders and nodded in agreement.â€?But in remarks lasting nearly 40 minutes, Tillerson did not address the administrationâ€™s proposed 28 percent budget cut for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid, which would reduce funding for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. That proposal has made many American diplomats and aid workers anxious.  The Trump administration also has not named candidates for the vast majority of State Department positions requiring Senate confirmation, and many are being filled by career diplomats in â€œactingâ€?positions. Tillerson began his remarks by thanking those officials, to applause from the crowd. One veteran official who watched the speech criticized Tillersonâ€™s use of the â€œAmerica Firstâ€?slogan. The phrase was used in the 1930s by isolationists who sought to keep the United States out of World War Two. â€œThe fact that they still use â€˜America Firstâ€?shows they know nothing about history, and whatâ€™s worse is they donâ€™t care. â€œItâ€™s offensive,â€?said the official, who requested anonymity. Tillersonâ€™s remarks followed an invitation to State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development employees this week to participate in an online survey to help identify â€œefficiency improvements,â€?in line with a March directive from Trump to â€œreorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies.â€?In his speech, the secretary urged employees to fill out the survey and give input on how to reform the agency. Tillerson said the State Department, like many institutions, was built for the Cold War era. He said he recognized that deep change to the State Department â€œis really stressful for a lot of peopleâ€?and said the administration has â€œno preconceived notions on the outcomeâ€?of a review. One State Department official faulted Tillerson for not talking in detail about the budget cuts, as well as for not taking questions from employees. Previous secretaries of state, including Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, held question-and-answer sessions with State Department employees within weeks of taking office. â€œThey wanted to make this look like he was talking to us, but it was more about the appearance than any substance,â€?said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Two other State Department officials, however, spoke highly of Tillersonâ€™s remarks, saying it was early to expect him to take questions from the rank and file and saying he provided guidance both on foreign policy and on the challenge of reorganizing the department. â€œI can understand folks wanting more details. I just donâ€™t think we are in a place where he can provide more details,â€?said one of these officials about the expected State Department budget cuts. â€œMy big takeaway was put on your big-girl britches, and when you look back you will feel like you were part of making this reform happen.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1
0480,"Trump vows to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, offers no new policies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to do â€œwhatever is necessaryâ€?to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians as he hosted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House, but gave no sign of how he could revive long-stalled negotiations. In their first meeting, Trump pressed Abbas to do more to stop â€œincitement to violenceâ€?against Israelis and, according to the White House, urged him in private to halt payments to families of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a demand long pressed by Israel. Even as Trump boldly predicted he would achieve peace where other presidents had failed, he stopped short of explicitly recommitting his administration to a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict, a long-standing foundation of U.S. policy. Some Palestinians said they were disappointed by the omission. Despite what many experts see as a long-shot bid, Trump told Abbas: â€œI will do whatever is necessary. ... I would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator, and we will get this done.â€?Abbas reasserted the goal of a Palestinian state, saying it must have East Jerusalem as its capital with the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.  Most Israelis want all of Jerusalem as their capital and reject a full return to 1967 borderlines as a threat to their security. Trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough, not least because his administration has yet to articulate a cohesive strategy for restarting the moribund peace process. Abbasâ€?White House talks followed a February visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who moved to reset ties after a combative relationship with the Republican presidentâ€™s predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama.  Trump sparked international criticism at the time, when he appeared to back away from a two-state solution, saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide. Palestinian statehood has been the objective of successive U.S. administrations and the international community. The meeting with Abbas, the Western-backed head of the Palestinian Authority, was another test of whether Trump, in office a little more than 100 days, is serious about pursuing the kind of comprehensive peace deal that eluded his predecessors. Trump insisted he was ready to try to reach the â€œtoughest deal.â€?But when he later sat down to lunch with the Palestinian leader, he said it was â€œmaybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years.â€?Trump, who said he decided to â€œstart a processâ€?but offered no new policy prescriptions or timetable, may be underestimating the challenge when trust between the two sides is low, analysts said. â€œYou canâ€™t just pretend you only have to handle a few key issues and thatâ€™s it,â€?said David Makovsky, a member of Obamaâ€™s negotiating team during the last talks, which collapsed in 2014. Still, plans are being firmed up for Trump to visit Netanyahu in Jerusalem and possibly Abbas in the West Bank on May 22 and 23, say people familiar with the matter. That has sparked speculation about a meeting of the three. U.S. and Israeli officials have declined to confirm the visit. Trump and Abbas appeared friendly but businesslike as they stood at side-by-side lecterns. But that was a far cry from the way Trump and Netanyahu interacted in February. Abbas promised that under â€œyour courageous stewardship and your wisdom, as well as your great negotiating ability,â€?the Palestinians would be partners seeking a â€œhistoric peace treaty.â€?But under pressure at home to avoid major concessions, the 82-year-old leader said: â€œItâ€™s about time for Israel to end its occupation,â€?referring to Jewish settlements in the West  Bank. Abbas, however, did not repeat in public his demand that Israel freeze settlement construction on land Palestinians want for a state as a condition for negotiations. U.S. lawmakers have warned that Palestinian funding could be cut off unless Abbas halts PLO stipends to families of prisoners whom Israel considers terrorists but many Palestinians see as heroes. There was no indication Abbas, who governs in the West Bank while Hamas militants rule Gaza, bowed to pressure on the issue, especially with hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike. In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the promises Abbas made at the White House â€œdonâ€™t obligate anyone.â€?Questions have been raised about Trumpâ€™s choice of son-in-law Jared Kushner to oversee the peace initiative, along with Trumpâ€™s longtime business lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, as envoy. Efforts to enlist Israelâ€™s Sunni Arab neighbors, who share Israeli concerns about Shiâ€™ite Iran, to help rejuvenate peacemaking, have yet to yield results. National security adviser H.R. McMaster described Trumpâ€™s foreign policy approach as â€œdisruptive,â€?saying his unconventional ways could create an opportunity to help stabilize the Middle East. But Trumpâ€™s unpredictability has even at times rattled a close ally like Israel. His pro-Israeli campaign rhetoric suggested he might give Netanyahu free rein. But Trumpâ€™s promise to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv is on the back burner, and he caught Netanyahu off-guard by asking him to put unspecified limits on settlement activity.

0481,"FBI's Comey defends Clinton email probe announcement, but feels 'nauseous'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey said on Wednesday it made him â€œmildly nauseousâ€?to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails affected the 2016 presidential election, but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again. In four hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey delivered his most impassioned defense yet of a decision that many Democrats believe cost them the White House: telling Congress 11 days before the Nov. 8 election that the FBI had uncovered a new trove of Clinton-related emails. Comey said he felt he had to speak out at that time because he had repeatedly told lawmakers the Clinton email probe was over. â€œTo not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view,â€?Comey said. â€œConcealing, in my view, would be catastrophic.â€?He told the panel one reason for the FBIâ€™s renewed interest in Clintonâ€™s case was that investigators had found emails, some of them classified, forwarded by Clintonâ€™s assistant Huma Abedin to her husband, who was not authorized to see such information. â€œIt makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election, but honestly, it wouldnâ€™t change the decision,â€?Comey said. The FBI, which is supposed to remain politically neutral, said a few days later that the new emails did not change its  decision not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton, but many Democrats believe the political damage was done. Clinton said on Tuesday her election bid was derailed in part by Comeyâ€™s announcement about the renewed probe of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. She said her effort also was damaged by the WikiLeaks release of her campaign chairman John Podestaâ€™s emails, allegedly stolen by Russian hackers.         Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member on the committee, led the Democrats in hammering Comey with questions about why he went public with the Clinton probe but kept silent on an  investigation related to the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. â€œItâ€™s still very unclear - and I hope director that you will clear this up - why the FBIâ€™s treatment of these two investigations was so dramatically different,â€?she asked.  U.S. intelligence agencies in December accused Russia of hacking of Democratic emails in an effort to tilt the election to Trump. Comey confirmed in March the FBI was investigating possible collusion between Trump surrogates and Russia. Comey said on Wednesday the probe into whether Russian hacking activities and American citizens was a classified investigation in its early stages â€?far different from the almost completed email probe.   Comey declined to comment on whether Trump, or anyone else, had been ruled out as a possible subject. Moscow has denied the hacking allegations. The FBI director acknowledged recent months have been difficult. â€œBut I think Iâ€™ve done the right thing at each turn. Iâ€™m not on anybodyâ€™s side. Itâ€™s so hard for people to see that,â€?Comey said, adding later, â€œI donâ€™t have any regrets.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1
0482,"Trump gains traction on healthcare bill, vote set for Thursday","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s effort to roll back Obamacare gained momentum on Wednesday as Republican leaders scheduled a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday on newly revised legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate Republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could now support it. A vote was expected as early as midday Thursday, with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a week-long recess. Late on Wednesday, the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the House floor. Even if a narrow majority in the House approves the bill, it still faces a steep climb in the Senate, where only a few defections could kill the effort. Keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in January, Trump threw his own political capital behind the bill, meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support. Trump, whose Republican party controls both the House and Senate, is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Aides said he worked the phones furiously. Wavering moderate Republicans had worried that the  legislation to overhaul President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2010 signature healthcare law would leave too many people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage. But several Republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with Trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous Democratic opposition. The legislationâ€™s prospects brightened further after members of the Freedom Caucus, a faction of conservative lawmakers in the House who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month, said they could go along with the compromise. The bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups, including the American Medical Association, who say millions of Americans will lose coverage or face higher costs. Millions more Americans got healthcare coverage under Obamacare, but Republicans have long attacked it. They view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs. Called the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including a penalty for not buying health insurance. It would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of Medicaidâ€™s expansion.  The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice, underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the Republican partyâ€™s divided factions. Earlier this week, prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate Republicans said they could not support the bill, citing their concerns about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Putting a spotlight on the concerns about pre-existing conditions, late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in Obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son.   Kimmelâ€™s monologue about his sonâ€™s congenital heart condition was viewed nearly 19 million times on his showâ€™s Facebook page and on Wednesday morning was the No. 1 trending story on YouTube. Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the White House with Trump, said the president endorsed their plan to add $8 billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre-existing illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets. Describing Trumpâ€™s efforts to secure his support, Long said Trump told him: â€œâ€˜Billy we really need you, man.â€™â€?Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the new language on pre-existing conditions was a â€œnet plusâ€?for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill. Critics of the changes to the law, including several health policy experts, said the $8 billion could not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients. Republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost. Health insurers, such as Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N), have faced months of uncertainty over healthcareâ€™s future. So have hospital companies, such as HCA Holdings Inc (HCA.N) and Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N). On Wednesday, Aetna said it will exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in Virginia next year, citing â€œgrowing uncertaintyâ€?and expected losses this year. House Democrats rejected the latest change to the Republican legislation on Wednesday, saying patients with pre-existing illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs.  â€œThis is deadly,â€?House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told a news conference. â€œNo Band-Aid will fix it.â€? Democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the Senate, where only a few Republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward. The difficulty in the House is now making Democrats optimistic that Republicans will face backlash from voters and face losing seats in the 2018 midterm elections. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1

0486,Senate votes to repeal Labor Department rule on state-run retirement plans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted narrowly on Wednesday to repeal an exemption from strict federal protections that former President Barack Obamaâ€™s Labor Department had given to state-sponsored retirement savings plans for lower-income workers.  The exemption, championed by states such as California but opposed by the mutual fund industry, had freed the state-run plans from the strict compliance requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and who often have low incomes, are automatically enrolled in plans being launched in some states, such as Illinois. States say the exemption would have let employers pass workersâ€?money into plans without footing ERISA compliance costs. It stoked fights in Washington, however, over the reach of federal regulation, statesâ€?rights and income inequality. The Republican-led Senate passed the resolution repealing the exemption by a vote of 50-49. The House of Representatives, also controlled by Republicans, previously approved the measure, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law.  It was the 14th Obama-era rule killed by Congress under the once-obscure Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted regulations and forbids agencies from enacting similar rules in the future. In mid-April, Trump signed a nearly identical resolution affecting city-run retirement plans, which are in the design stages. But the resolution for state-run plans was stuck in limbo for weeks, as Republicans struggled to gather votes and major lobby groups representing retirees and business interests turned up the heat on lawmakers. Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, missed Wednesdayâ€™s vote because of minor heart surgery, helping the Senate avoid a tie. Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana broke party ranks to oppose the resolution, saying Americans were in a â€œreal and ongoing crisisâ€?to save enough money for retirement. â€œWhile state-based retirement plans are not my first choice, if implemented carefully, they could help close the retirement savings gap,â€?he said in a statement to Reuters. The California planâ€™s primary champion, Democratic state Senator Kevin de Leon, expressed outrage at the vote, saying taxpayers would ultimately foot the bills of people who retire without adequate savings. â€œWall Street investment firms fear their profits will take a hit ... even though the investment industry has historically ignored middle- and lower-income workers at medium- and small-sized businesses,â€?he said in a statement. The mutual fund, insurance and securities industries said the exemption would have denied some workers protections that are guaranteed for others.  â€œDenying ERISA protections to workers who are automatically enrolled would limit their legal remedies to fight against high fees or mismanagement of the plans,â€?said Paul Schott Stevens, president of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing funds holding $19.3 trillion in assets and that are often used to save for retirement.

0487,Obama details plans for Chicago presidential center,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday unveiled design plans for his Chicago presidential center, which he hopes will serve as a training site for future generations of leaders.  The Obama Presidential Center will be built in the 500-acre (200-hectare) Jackson Park on Chicagoâ€™s South Side. The park was first developed as the site of the 1893 Worldâ€™s Fair.  The development will feature three buildings - a museum, forum and library - forming a campus around a plaza. The museum, the tallest of the three structures, will include public areas, offices and classrooms in addition to exhibition space, the Obama Foundation said in a statement.  â€œWhat we want this to be is the worldâ€™s premier institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world. That is our goal,â€?Obama said at the design unveiling in Chicago.  Obama has slowly started to return to the public eye since leaving office in January. Last month he moderated an event at the University of Chicago during his first major appearance since leaving the White House. The project will take around four years to complete, Obama said, but educational programs will begin this year. Obama said Wednesday he would donate $2 million to a summer jobs programs in the community.   Obama grew up in Hawaii and went to college in New York and California, but owns a home and spent most of his pre-White House political career in Chicago, starting as a community activist before becoming an Illinois state senator and then a U.S. senator. Chicago beat out proposals by New York City and Hawaii to be the home of the library. Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects Partners of New York and Interactive Design Architects of Chicago were named last year as the firms that will lead the design of the center. Residents of Chicagoâ€™s South Side, which includes many poor and crime-ridden neighborhoods, hope jobs and investment come with the library. Some small businesses are concerned they may be forced out of the area if rental prices go up. The center could be a transformational project for the community, Obama said. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1
0488,"Factbox: Republicans' Obamacare plan would dump Medicaid expansion, taxes","(Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010. Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion, with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The first version of the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, would have left 24 million more Americans without coverage, according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers. The House has recently added two amendments to the AHCA to try to appease both conservatives and moderates. Here are the latest versions of the billâ€™s main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacareâ€™s most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parentsâ€?health plan until age 26 and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. An amendment introduced by moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur would let states opt out of Obamacareâ€™s mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacareâ€™s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health treatment.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. An amendment added Wednesday would provide another $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance. The bill would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. The Republicans want to end in 2018 Obamacareâ€™s income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacareâ€™s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as â€œCadillacâ€?plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states chose not to expand. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1
0489,U.S. House passes bill to fund government through September,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a $1.2 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September and avoid federal agency shutdowns on Saturday when existing money is depleted. With the 309-118 vote in the Republican-controlled chamber, the legislation now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it before a midnight Friday deadline. The Pentagon is a big winner in the legislation, with defense spending rising significantly. While the bill cleared the House easily, dozens more Democrats voted for it than Republicans, many of whom oppose most spending measures. This was the first major legislation to pass the House this year with bipartisan support and marks Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s first legislative victory, even though he railed against some of its provisions. The legislation bulks up federal funding for border security but does not pay for starting construction on a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump promised to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. Trump had said he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the Mexican government refused, making it necessary for the new administration to ask Congress for the money. Democrats and many Republicans have argued that a wall is an ineffective and wasteful way of securing the southern border. Another battle over the barrier is expected when Congress tries to pass a spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Trump already has begun focusing on that upcoming fight. In a tweet on Tuesday, he taunted lawmakers, saying, â€œOur country needs a good â€˜shutdownâ€?in September to fix mess!â€?The legislation would add $12.5 billion this fiscal year for the Pentagon, with another $2.5 billion available after Trump gives details on his plans for defeating the Islamic State militant group. It ignores many of the spending cuts on domestic programs the White House had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Ricoâ€™s underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million to fight fires in Western states. But the legislation is late in coming. The fiscal year began last Oct. 1 and for the last seven months federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous yearâ€™s funding and the priorities that came with that.

0490,Changes at helm of U.S. bank agency signal new Trump era,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3.  The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices. Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts. Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers. â€œCurry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think youâ€™re likely to see less of that going forward,â€?said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha.  The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how much banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. â€œThis is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements,â€?Seiberg said. Trumpâ€™s plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the governmentâ€™s current lean crew of regulators. While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCCâ€™s changing of the guard might not be so smooth. Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014.  Noreikaâ€™s background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financialâ€™s acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial. â€œIt is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency,â€?Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. Noreikaâ€™s appointment does not require Senate approval. Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension.  While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co.  The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies. There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation. Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate. Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1

Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who had rejected an earlier bill to roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, told reporters after a meeting with Trump at the White House that they could now vote for the plan with their proposed changes. Upton said the revised bill could come up for a vote on Thursday, although both he and Long said they did not know whether there were enough votes to pass it. Representative Michael Burgess also said he could back the legislation. ",politicsNews,2017/5/3,1

0494,Russian election hacking 'wildly successful' in creating discord: former U.S. lawmaker,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Russia succeeded in its goals of sowing discord in U.S. politics by meddling in the 2016 presidential election, which will likely inspire similar future efforts, two top former U.S. voices on intelligence said on Tuesday. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers agreed at a panel at Harvard University that Russia likely believed it had achieved its goals and could attempt to repeat its performance in elections in other countries. â€œTheir purpose was to sew discontent and mistrust in our elections they wanted us to be at each othersâ€?throat when it was over,â€?Rogers said at the panel at Harvardâ€™s Kennedy School of Government. â€œItâ€™s influencing, I would say, legislative process today. Thatâ€™s wildly successful.â€?Congressional committees have been investigating the issue since U.S. intelligence agencies in January concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to sway the election toward Republican Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any such meddling and Trump has been dismissive of the intelligence suggesting Russian involvement. Clapper said that Russia had long sought to influence U.S. voter behavior but discovered it could be far more effective at a lower cost by using social media to spread misinformation. â€œThis is the most assertive, most aggressive and most directly impactful of any engagement that they have had in our elections,â€?Clapper said at the event, in Cambridge, Massachusetts just outside Boston. â€œThey have to regard what they did as a huge success. Theyâ€™ve been doing it in France and theyâ€™ll do it in Germany.â€?Russia has also denied attempting to influence Franceâ€™s presidential election. Rogers maintained that he did not believe that Russia had specifically attempted to boost Trumpâ€™s chances of victory.  â€œThey saw the same polls that we did,â€?Rogers said. â€œSome notion that the Russians knew that Trump had an opportunity to win this thing more than U.S. public pollsters thought, I find ridiculous.â€?The congressional probe on whether Russia attempted to influence the election in favor is not the only investigation into relations between Moscow and the Trump administration. The Pentagon has also launched an investigation into whether Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s former national security adviser, accepted money from foreign entities without the required approval.     Clapper is set to testify to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the matter next week. ",politicsNews,2017/5/2,1
0495,Trump nominee for China ambassador promises firm line on Beijing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for ambassador to China promised on Tuesday to take a firm line with Beijing on issues from North Korea to trade disputes and human rights, and seemed poised for an easy confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said he would use his decades of experience with China to press Beijing to do more to encourage North Korea to curb its nuclear ambitions. â€œThereâ€™s other things they can do diplomatically and economically to send a clear signal that they, as well as the United States and other countries in the world, do not tolerate this expansion of nuclear technology and missiles,â€?Branstad said at his confirmation hearing. Pressed, Branstad said â€œthere may well beâ€?a role for measures such as imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese banks or other entities that violated U.N. Security Council resolutions by doing business with North Korea. He offered few specifics. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China was serious about enforcing U.N. resolutions and, referring to the possibility of secondary U.S. sanctions, said China opposed other countries using their law to sanction others or to harm Chinese interests. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an â€œold friendâ€?after decades of dealings on agricultural trade. But the Republican governor insisted he would take on difficult issues complicating Washingtonâ€™s relationship with its largest trading partner and major creditor. That would contrast with Trumpâ€™s recent warm words for Xi, which have caused some U.S. allies to wonder if Trumpâ€™s focus on working with China on North Korea means Washington may not still have their backs. â€œThe fact that the leader of China calls us an old friend, doesnâ€™t mean that Iâ€™m going to be at all reluctant or bashful of bringing up issues ... be it human rights or intellectual property rights,â€?Branstad told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Committee members expressed few concerns about Branstad, signaling he likely will be confirmed easily. They had tough words for China. Senator Bob Corker, the panelâ€™s Republican chairman, blasted Chinaâ€™s actions in the South China Sea, and â€œcyber theft of intellectual property.â€?He warned against focusing on short-term goals at the expense of long-term U.S. interests. â€œThereâ€™s no country in the world that we have so many issues with,â€?Corker said. Branstad took a hard line on the South China Sea, saying, â€œChina cannot be allowed to use its artificial islands to coerce its neighbors or limit freedom of navigation or overflight.â€?Trump has taken an â€œAmerica Firstâ€?approach to trade. Branstad also stressed the importance of opening markets to agricultural goods, protecting intellectual property and addressing Chinaâ€™s â€œunfair and illegalâ€?sales of low-priced steel.

0496,"Trump urges future government shutdown, easier passage of laws","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump came to office promising that he would produce so much winning that Americans would be sick of it. As he struggles to produce wins, some signs of frustration are starting to appear. Democratsâ€?gleeful declarations that they outsmarted Republicans in a battle over a spending bill that avoided a government shutdown drew the ire of the president. Democrats were happy that funding for Trumpâ€™s Mexico border wall was not included.  Trump tweeted on Tuesday that maybe a government shutdown would not be so bad and that Republicans should consider changing Senate rules to make it easier to pass spending and other bills without any Democratic support.  â€œOur country needs a good â€˜shutdownâ€?in September to fix mess!â€?he wrote.  His comment frustrated some of his fellow Republicans in  Congress, who chafed at the suggestion that the White House could dictate Senate rules, or send a message that a shutdown, which costs the economy millions, was desirable. â€œI think it would be a good thing at this point if the iPhone was put in a safe, locked away and maybe returned in four years,â€?Republican Senator Bob Corker, who was once on the short list to be Trumpâ€™s vice president, told reporters. â€œThatâ€™s just not constructive. Those are the kinds of things that should never happen, and... itâ€™s damaging to our credibility. Itâ€™s damaging to trust here within the (Capitol) building,â€?Corker said. Trump marked his 100th day in office on Saturday and used last week to argue that he has made major progress in rolling back federal regulations and improving the climate for job creation. But with his healthcare reform effort flagging, Trump has been unable to get a major piece of legislation through a Congress controlled by his own Republican Party, leaving him without a signature victory. With Democrats celebrating concessions they extracted in the spending bill, Trump used a Rose Garden ceremony honoring the Air Force Academyâ€™s football team to declare he and Republicans got more from the legislation than might appear. â€œAfter years of partisan bickering and gridlock, this bill is a clear win for the American people,â€?Trump said. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney gave three news briefings to promote Trump gains from the bill, the first on Monday night and the second on Tuesday morning in a conference call for reporters. The conference call was marred by technical issues at times, with Mulvaney straining to be heard over orchestra music that mysteriously began playing. â€œAll right,â€?Mulvaney told reporters at one point. â€œIâ€™ll try to answer it one more time, and clearly weâ€™re having a lot of background noise here.â€?Later, in the White House briefing room, Mulvaney said he understood Trumpâ€™s frustration, accusing Democrats of trying to â€œspike the footballâ€?by publicly celebrating the budget deal as a Democratic victory in an effort to make the president look bad after he negotiated in good faith. He said Democrats were thwarted by Republicans in their attempt to add bailout money for Puerto Rico. â€œWeâ€™ve got a lot to do between now and September. I donâ€™t anticipate a shutdown in September, but if the Democrats arenâ€™t going to behave any better than they have in the last couple of days, it may be inevitable,â€?Mulvaney said. Democrats quickly denounced Trumpâ€™s musings about closing the federal government. â€œHere we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in the best traditions of the Senate, and the president disparages it in a way thatâ€™s destructive,â€?Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would debate the funding bill this week and that most Republicans did not favor a change in the rules to make it easier to pass legislation without Democratic support. Trump said his fellow Republicans had to acquiesce to Democratic demands in spending bill because the partyâ€™s majority was too slim to win the 60 Senate votes needed to advance the legislation without them. Republicans hold 52 of the Senateâ€™s 100 seats. â€œThe reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%,â€?Trump wrote on Twitter  Republicans last forced a government closure in 2013 for 17 days.

0498,Trump struggles to win over moderate Republicans on healthcare overhaul,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Time was running short for President Donald Trump to attract enough votes to pass a new bill to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system this week as Republican party moderates held out, fearing a backlash from voters worried about losing insurance benefits. A senior House of Representatives Republican aide said on Tuesday night no decision had been made on bringing legislation to the floor this week before the House is due to start a week-long break late on Thursday. A bill would need to be filed by late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning to hold the vote before the break.  Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus faction that helped block Trumpâ€™s first attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, said earlier on Tuesday Republicans were still â€œa handful of votes away.â€?The lack of movement among Republicans puts Trump in danger of his second major legislative setback, raising questions about his ability to secure passage of other parts of his agenda, including a major tax reform plan. Most House Freedom Caucus Republicans have gotten on board with the new proposal, but Democrats are vowing to oppose any attempt to unravel Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare overhaul.  The latest Republican plan would allow states to opt out of Obamacare provisions that force insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same rates. That is seen as a concession to conservatives to attract their votes. Trump insisted in an interview with CBS News that aired on Sunday that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would remain. â€œI think itâ€™s time nowâ€?for a healthcare vote, the Republican president said at the White House on Tuesday.   Even if a plan passes the House, it is expected to face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower majority. Republicans contend that Obamaâ€™s signature 2010 healthcare law, which allowed some 20 million Americans to gain medical insurance, is too intrusive and expensive. The White House sent Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol on Tuesday to meet Republican holdouts on the partyâ€™s latest effort to pass a healthcare overhaul. Republicans remain divided over key aspects of the healthcare bill, with some lawmakers worrying about a potential spike in the number of people without coverage, or sharp increases in insurance premiums. Representative Daniel Webster, whose central Florida district is home to many retirees, said Pence told him he would try to work out problems caused by proposed Medicaid spending caps that would limit nursing-home beds. â€œI just think itâ€™s going to cost us a lot in Florida,â€?Webster said. Another Florida Republican, Thomas Rooney, said confusion over the potential loss of coverage for pre-existing conditions had his constituents scared that â€œtheyâ€™re going to die because of a vote that we might be taking.â€?Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action started to increase pressure on moderate Republicans who were resisting the bill, such as Representative Billy Long of  Missouri. â€œBilly is using liberal talking points to distort the truth,â€?Club for Growth President David McIntosh said, adding that Long â€œmay want to keep Obamacare.â€?Left-leaning groups, including the Center for American Progress (CAP), were pushing their members to call lawmakers to urge them to oppose the healthcare bill, including via 7,000 medicine bottles delivered to congressional districts. Emily Tisch Sussman, a CAP organizer, said those efforts had generated â€œtens of thousandsâ€?of phone calls. Patient advocacy groups, including the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, also oppose the reworked bill, while the American Medical Association and others have expressed concerns.

0499,"Democrats dig in, delay against Dodd-Frank overhaul","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives opposed to Republican legislation that would repeal major sections of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law on Tuesday made multiple efforts to delay the bill. The House Financial Services Committee was due to consider Representative Jeb Hensarlingâ€™s sweeping bill to rework the 2010 law. In addition to eliminating large portions of Dodd-Frank - enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis - it would put new handcuffs on regulators charged with writing and enforcing its rules. The partisan maneuvering to slow work on the bill demonstrated how divided the two parties are regarding rules for the financial sector, casting doubt on Congressâ€™s ability to revisit them significantly despite Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s vow to â€œdo a numberâ€?on existing regulations. First, Democrats ordered a vote on whether the committee even wanted to actually consider the bill. That amendment passed with support from only the Republican majority. Then, Democrats ordered that all 589 pages of the law be read out loud by the committee clerk. The reading of legislative language is almost always waived by committee members when considering a bill. After about 3-1/2 hours of the bill being read to a largely empty committee room, Democrats agreed to shelve that request and proceed to the amendments they wanted to offer. Democrats had drawn up roughly 140 amendments they wanted to offer to change the bill, according to a House aide. But that number is expected to shrink as the two parties work out a path forward. Hensarling announced on Tuesday that despite earlier plans to vote on amendments to the bill throughout the day, no votes would be held on the bill until Wednesday morning at the earliest. The procedural obstacles were all aimed at a bill that is not expected to actually become law, as the sweeping rewrite of Dodd-Frank is not expected to garner enough support in the Senate, which the Republicans hold by a slim majority.  But it is expected to pass the Republican-led House, and the skirmish over it was a clear indication of how much Democrats are willing to dig in on measures that would make life easier for the financial sector. â€œThis is one of the worst bills Iâ€™ve seen in my time in Congress,â€?said Representative Maxine Waters, the committeeâ€™s top Democrat, as the committee began debate on the measure. â€œThe bill is rotten to the core, and simply carries water for Trump and his buddies on Wall Street.â€?Hensarlingâ€™s bill would allow large banks to avoid most Dodd-Frank rules if they agree to establish a 10 percent capital ratio, and also scraps several powers given to regulators after the financial crisis to more closely scrutinize some of the nationâ€™s largest institutions. It also makes several changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, severely limiting its power and giving Congress and the White House more direct control over its operations and funding.

0500,NSA collected Americans' phone records despite law change: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency collected more than 151 million records of Americansâ€?phone calls last year, even after Congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records, according to an annual report issued on Tuesday by the top U.S. intelligence officer. The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism. It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year.     The NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone â€œmetadata,â€?records of callersâ€?and recipientsâ€?phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls - but not their content - since the September 11, 2001, attacks. The report came as Congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information on non-U.S. persons outside the United States, and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Privacy advocates have argued that Section 702 permits the NSA to spy on Internet and telephone communications of Americans without warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements. The report said that on one occasion in 2016, the FBI obtained information about an American in response to a search of Section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence.  The report did not address how frequently the FBI obtained information about Americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter, however. On Friday, the NSA said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant.     The new report also came amid allegations, recently repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser Susan Rice asked the NSA to unmask the names of U.S. persons caught in the surveillance. Both Republican and Democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation. Officials on Tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013. Because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers, the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller, the officials said. They said they had no breakdown of how many individualsâ€?phone records were among those collected.  In all, according to the report, U.S. officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, the top U.S. intelligence officer reported on Tuesday. The report said the names of 1,934 â€œU.S. personsâ€?were â€œunmaskedâ€?last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds. Officials said in the report that U.S. intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about U.S. electronic eavesdropping. â€œThis yearâ€™s report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law,â€?said Office of the Director of National Intelligence spokesman Timothy Barrett.

0501,"Restaurant, retail calorie disclosure rule in flux under Trump","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A much-delayed U.S. rule requiring restaurants and retailers to clearly display food calorie counts has been pushed back again, and could be rewritten or scrapped as the Trump administration rebuffs Obama-era regulations. Notice came shortly after the U.S. Department of Agriculture relaxed some school lunch rules that were part of former first lady Michelle Obamaâ€™s signature effort to fight childhood obesity. The Food and Drug Administration late on Monday extended the compliance date for the calorie labeling rule from May 5, 2017, to May 7, 2018, to enable further consideration of ways to cut costs and make requirements more flexible. The rule was designed to help U.S. consumers, who eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home, battle the bulge. It is part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, which the Trump administration has vowed to repeal and replace in a bid to slash regulations it considers harmful to business.  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who oversees the FDA, said in a statement his agency believed in promoting sound nutrition and applauded the delay. â€œImposing burdensome rules that leave business managers and owners worried about harsh potential penalties and less able to serve their customers is unwise and unhelpful,â€?Price said. The ruleâ€™s opponents, including Dominoâ€™s Pizza Inc, movie theater operators, and convenience and grocery stores, have pushed for delays over the years.   But even if the calorie disclosure rule is killed at the federal level, it is unlikely to go away. Chains like Panera Bread Co and McDonaldâ€™s Corp, have been displaying such information for years in compliance with rules set by California, New York City and other jurisdictions. Panera in 2010 became the first national chain to post calorie counts for its salads, sandwiches and pastries.  Sara Burnett, Paneraâ€™s director of food policy and wellness, said customers want to know what is in the food they eat, so the chain will continue to comply with the federal law as it was written. â€œItâ€™s information that helps our guests make informed decisions,â€?Burnett said.

0502,U.S. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin undergoes heart procedure,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the chamberâ€™s second-ranking Democrat, had a procedure on Tuesday in Chicago to correct an irregular heartbeat, his office said.  Durbin, 72, was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for an â€œatrial flutter,â€?which occurs when the heart beats too quickly. The condition was discovered during a recent annual physical, the Illinois lawmakerâ€™s office said.  â€œI anticipate that this heart tune-up will give my classic roadster many more miles of reliable service,â€?Durbin said in a statement.  Durbin had no symptoms and was able to maintain his regular schedule before and after the condition was discovered. He is scheduled to remain in Illinois for the rest of the week.   Durbin used the statement about his outpatient procedure to criticize Republican efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  â€œMy Congressional colleagues who want to cut funding for medical research and take away health insurance for millions of Americans should remember that all of us are only one diagnosis away from needing the best care for ourselves and the people we love,â€?he said.

0503,U.S. Senate votes to confirm Jay Clayton as SEC chairman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency tasked with policing and writing rules for Wall Street. In a 61-37 vote, the Senate approved the nomination, with some moderate Democrats joining their Republican colleagues in supporting his confirmation. Clayton could be officially sworn in as SEC chairman as soon as Thursday. The White House still must complete some paperwork, including an action by President Trump to formally designate him as SEC chairman. Clayton is a longtime partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in advising clients on public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts.  Clayton worked on the initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Company, and has also represented Goldman Sachs, where his wife Gretchen works.  She is now expected to step down from her post, a move that will make it easier for her husband to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. â€œI look forward to working closely with my fellow Commissioners and the dedicated career staff at the SEC to serve the American public and advance the SECâ€™s important mission,â€?Clayton said in a statement. Many current and former SEC staffers are optimistic about Claytonâ€™s leadership, and Clayton is expected to focus some of his efforts on looking for ways to ease regulatory burdens that might hinder companies from raising capital. But in the debate leading up to the Senate vote on Tuesday, more progressive-leaning Democrats said they were concerned his close ties to Wall Street will create too many conflicts and may lead to weaker oversight. â€œMr. Claytonâ€™s law firm and former clients will create a steady stream of conflicts for him, forcing him to recuse himself in cases involving former clients for two of the four years he could serve as chair,â€?said Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.  â€œHe will be sitting on the sidelines of potential enforcement actions against some of the biggest Wall Street banks - Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and UBS,â€?he added.

0504,"Clinton says Comey's letter, Russian hackers cost her the election","(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday she was on the path to victory in the 2016 presidential election until late interference by Russian hackers and FBI Director James Comey scared off some potential supporters. In her most extensive public comments on the Nov. 8 election, Clinton told a New York conference she was derailed by Comeyâ€™s Oct. 28 letter informing Congress the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reopened a probe of her use of a private email server and by the WikiLeaks release of campaign chairman John Podestaâ€™s emails, allegedly stolen by Russian hackers. â€œIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,â€?she told a womenâ€™s conference moderated by CNNâ€™s Christiane Amanpour. â€œIt wasnâ€™t a perfect campaign, but I was on the way to winning until a combination of Comeyâ€™s letter and Russian WikiLeaks,â€?the Democrat said of the loss to Republican Donald Trump. â€œThe reason why I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.â€?Clinton, who said she is going through the â€œpainful processâ€?of writing a book dealing in part with the election, also said misogyny played a role in her defeat. Becoming the first woman U.S. president would have been â€œa really big deal,â€?she said. Clinton took personal responsibility for the campaignâ€™s mistakes, but did not question her strategy or her staff. â€œI was the candidate, I was the person who was on the ballot. I am very aware of the challenges, the problems, the shortfalls that we had,â€?Clinton said. She said she had no doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to influence the election for Trump, and bluntly criticized the new U.S. president for some of his foreign policy views and for tweeting too much. â€œIâ€™m back to being an activist citizen - and part of the resistance,â€?she said. Clinton said broader negotiations involving China and other countries in the region were critical for convincing North Korea to rein in its nuclear program. She questioned Trumpâ€™s recent suggestion he would be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un under the right circumstances. â€œYou should not offer that in the absence of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table,â€?Clinton said. She also said she supported the recent missile strikes ordered by Trump in Syria but was unsure if they would make a difference. â€œThere is a lot that we donâ€™t really yet fully know about what was part of that strike,â€?she said.

0505,"Trump, Putin discuss Syria ceasefire in first talks since U.S. air strikes","WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday moved to ease the tension from U.S. air strikes in April against Russian ally Syria, expressing a desire for a Syrian ceasefire and safe zones for the civil warâ€™s refugees. The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since U.S. relations with Russian were strained by the U.S. attack on a Syrian airfield. They two leaders set the foundation for what could be their first face-to-face meeting in July. Statements from both the White House and the Kremlin suggested the two leaders had a productive conversation that included North Korea and fighting Islamist militants throughout the Middle East. A senior Trump administration official said Putin had requested the call and described it as an effort to present his ideas for Syria.  Trump ordered 59 cruise missiles launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that the United States blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The attacked prompted protests from Assad ally Russia, which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of outlawed nerve gas and said Assad was not at fault. The White House said the two leaders agreed that â€œall parties must do all they can to end the violenceâ€?in Syria. â€œThe conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons,â€?a White House statement said. Trump during his presidential campaign last year frequently said he wanted safe zones established for Syrian refugees, paid for by Gulf states, to alleviate any need for the refugees to move elsewhere, including to the United States. Candidate Trump had also expressed a desire for a U.S. alliance with Russia to fight Islamist militants, a goal that has been elusive since he took office on Jan. 20. With a ceasefire ever elusive in Syria, the White House said Washington would send a representative to ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The State Department said acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones will attend as an observer. The decision to send Jones to the talks, even as an observer, is an indication that the United States is taking the Astana talks more seriously. Previously, the U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George Krol had attended the talks as an observer. The Kremlin said Putin and Trump agreed to step up dialogue on finding ways to strengthen a ceasefire and give it stability. â€œThe aim is to create the conditions for the launch for a real resolution process in Syria. This means that the Russian foreign minister and U.S. secretary of state will effectively inform the leaders about progress in this direction.â€?The White House statement said Trump and Putin also â€œspoke about how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea.â€?With North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and ballistic missile programs posing a major global challenge, the two leaders also discussed how to go about resolving a crisis that has raised tensions throughout the Asia-Pacific. Trump told Reuters in an interview last week that a â€œmajor, major conflictâ€?was possible with North Korea, amping up pressure on Pyongyang to stand down and for China to rein in the north. â€œThe dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula was discussed in detail. Vladimir Putin called for restraint and for the level of tension to be reduced,â€?the Kremlin said. The two leaders also discussed having a their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg July 7-8, the Kremlin said. ",politicsNews,2017/5/2,1

0507,Conservative U.S. think tank Heritage Foundation fires leader,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative think tank that has gained influence in Republican-controlled Washington, fired its leader Jim DeMint on Tuesday, and sources close to the situation said the organizationâ€™s leadership determined he had veered too far from its conservative principals and too close to U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s White House. A scathing statement from Thomas A. Saunders III, chairman of The Heritage Foundationâ€™s Board of Trustees, did not go into specifics of any disagreement but did cite problems with internal communications and other â€œmanagement issues.â€?â€œAfter a comprehensive and independent review of the entire Heritage organization, the Board determined there were significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation,â€?Saunders said in a statement. â€œWhile the organization has seen many successes, Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems.â€? Two political operatives who work with the organization said DeMintâ€™s opponents argued that he had grown too close to Trump and too far from the conservative principles on which the organization was founded. Ed Feulner, who previously served as the Heritage president, will return to the role in an interim capacity until a replacement is found, according to a statement from the Heritage board.  DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina, took over the organization in 2013 after he retired from public office. Since then, he has transformed the organization once known for research and white papers into a political behemoth. For instance, he created an arm of the organization devoted entirely to influencing elections and pushing lawmakers to side with the groupâ€™s policy positions. But as DeMint transformed the organization, unease grew within its ranks, according to the sources.  After Trump was elected, more than a dozen staffers from the Heritage Foundation and its political arm Heritage Action were deployed as volunteers to help with the transition process. Heritage staffers worked on teams deployed to set up a Trump government at the EPA, the Office of Management and Budget and the departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, State and Treasury. An additional seven volunteers on the transition team had ties to Heritage, either having worked there before or working as a non-staff expert with the think tank. ",politicsNews,2017/5/2,1

0510,Florida LGBT rights push reflects changing times,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - A Republican, a Democrat and a lobbyist for leading businesses in Florida huddled this spring at the state Capitol, mapping out the next move in a campaign to enact the first statewide LGBT anti-discrimination law in the U.S. South. A record number of Republican lawmakers had thrown their support behind proposed protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and hundreds of companies backed the cause. While the bill has so far fallen short with time running out on the legislative session, its lead backers were heartened by their progress and determined to retool for next year. â€œWe definitely need to ramp up the grassroots,â€?said Joseph Salzverg, a lobbyist for Florida Competes, a group of more than 450 state businesses supporting LGBT protections. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of Republicans that agree with the policy but are worried about the effect it has back home.â€?A year after transgender bathroom access erupted as a U.S. culture wars flashpoint, Florida is among the conservative statehouses where LGBT activists see momentum building for affirmative legislation. The nationâ€™s third most-populous state, Florida could offer the next breakthrough in a national movement to advance LGBT civil-rights protections, viewed by advocates as stepping stones to their ultimate goal of federal anti-discrimination law. Only 18 states, mostly concentrated in the U.S. West and Northeast, and the District of Columbia have laws that fully guard against LGBT people being fired from jobs, kicked out of housing or denied services in restaurants, hotels and other businesses. This fight continues even after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage nationally. Floridaâ€™s strategy, years in the making, aims to build bipartisan support with economic arguments and the passage of similar measures locally that show the LGBT protections can succeed. The billâ€™s backers must convince a Republican-controlled state legislature that all of Florida benefits from LGBT protections. â€œItâ€™s really about the math of being based here in Florida, but competing on a global market,â€?said John â€œJ.T.â€?Tonnison, president of Florida Competes.  Tonnison is chief information officer of Tech Data Corp, a technology distributor. In the state capital of Tallahassee this spring, he told legislators about a prized recruit reluctant to relocate from California, concerned about a gay son visiting a state without strong protections.   â€œIt sets us apart in a less-than-positive light,â€?Tonnison said. Local LGBT protections are now in place in communities representing 60 percent of Floridaâ€™s more than 20 million residents. In conservative north Florida, the stateâ€™s largest city, Jacksonville, recently passed a nondiscrimination policy after a fight that lasted years. Local successes helped convince 19 Republican legislators to join 52 Democrats this year to cosponsor legislation that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to Floridaâ€™s civil rights statutes, just shy of a majority in the 160-member legislature. Representative Joe Gruters, an anti-abortion activist who co-chaired President Donald Trumpâ€™s state campaign, was among the first Republicans to sign on. Perhaps an unlikely LGBT ally, the first-term lawmaker said the case made by advocates, and a prominent conservative colleagueâ€™s support, resonated with him. â€œI will continue to fight for this, and for any type of right, that treats people fairly,â€?Gruters said. â€œItâ€™s going to happen.â€? By contrast, the Florida Family Policy Council, advocating for conservative social values, decried the legislation as an intrusion on religious freedoms and public safety by allowing men into womenâ€™s bathrooms and private facilities. Such LGBT measures are â€œweapons to punish Christians for simply acting out their faith in the marketplace,â€?said its president, John Stemberger.  â€œPeople are trying to force other people to do things,â€?he added. â€œWhy canâ€™t we just disagree?â€?But backers see Florida as a model for other states engaged in long-term legislative efforts, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. â€œAttracting bipartisan support really proves this isnâ€™t an urban versus a rural issue, or a Republican versus Democratic issue,â€?said Dan Rafter, a spokesman for the advocacy group Freedom for All Americans. Florida, and most other states, avoided fights this year over transgender bathroom access, possibly dissuaded by the national boycotts organized against North Carolina before its recent roll-back of restrictions enacted in 2016. Nonetheless, Floridaâ€™s LGBT protection bill never got a hearing during this session, which will end within days. The legislatureâ€™s leaders did not comment on what stalled the measure. Supporters are reorganizing for next year with a more pointed message. â€œInaction is not neutral,â€?said Hannah Willard, public policy director for the advocacy group Equality Florida. During the strategy meeting last month at the state Capitol, Republican Representative Rene Plasencia proposed mobilizing business supporters to engage legislators in their hometowns. â€œWe are protecting peopleâ€™s rights to live freely, to not be disadvantaged economically, because of the personal choice of who they love,â€?he said. Looking over a list of lawmakers not yet on board, the lead Democrat behind the House bill agreed. â€œWe need to persuade people before they get to Tallahassee,â€?Representative Ben Diamond said. â€œThatâ€™s the challenge.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/2,1

The trip could mark a repeat of the chaotic 2-1/2 months between the real estate developerâ€™s Nov. 8 election and Jan. 20 swearing-in, when crowds of protesters and admirers flocked outside his home in the gold-metal-clad Fifth Avenue Trump Tower. The early days of the Trump administration have brought aggressive rhetoric and moves to crack down on immigration as well as roll back environmental regulations, much of which has ruffled feathers in the liberal northeast city. Anti-Trump activists, some of whom have organized marches across the country since Trumpâ€™s stunning election victory, are planning loud protests to mark the native sonâ€™s return. â€œA very hot welcome is being planned for Mr. Trump,â€?said Alexis Danzig, a member of Rise and Resist, an informal group of activists which formed as Trump came to power. â€œWeâ€™ll be out in full force to voice our grievances.â€?Trumpâ€™s business dealings and romantic fallouts were constant city tabloid fodder in the 1980s and 1990s. His television show, â€œThe Apprentice,â€?broadcast Trump to the world as the ultimate Big Apple dealmaker during the 2000s.  While the Trump brand is internationally associated with New York, fewer than one in five city residents voted for him.  Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, have said his stance on immigrants has put him at odds with a city where nearly a third of residents are foreign-born.  Protesters plan to gather Thursday near the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, a decommissioned aircraft carrier where Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are to have their first in-person meeting. One of the pairâ€™s last exchanges was an acrimonious phone call in January. New York police declined to provide details of their preparations for Trumpâ€™s tour and the protests planned around it. One lingering issue from the transition period, that of the costs of protecting the president-electâ€™s building was resolved earlier this week in a proposed federal budget including $61 million to reimburse New York and other local governments for providing Trump-related security.  â€œThatâ€™s good news for our city and the hardworking police officers faced with this unprecedented security challenge,â€?de Blasio said in a statement.

0518,Trump questions why U.S. Civil War had to happen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump has shown a fascination with populist 19th-century U.S. president Andrew Jackson since he has occupied the Oval Office, hanging â€œOld Hickoryâ€™sâ€?portrait in the Oval Office, visiting his plantation in Tennessee and placing a wreath at his tomb. In an interview that aired on Sirius XM satellite radio on Monday, Trump suggested that if Jackson had governed a little later than his 1829-1837 presidency, the American Civil War might have been averted. Trump also questioned why the bloody conflict had to happen. â€œHad Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldnâ€™t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart,â€?Trump told Sirius XM. He said that although Jackson was a â€œswashbuckler,â€?after his wife died, Jackson visited her grave every day. Jackson, a slave owner who was instrumental in the forced removal of Native American tribes from the U.S. Southeast in the so-called Trail of Tears, died nearly 16 years before the start of the Civil War. But Trump told Sirius XM that Jackson â€œwas really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War.â€â€He said, â€˜Thereâ€™s no reason for this,â€™â€?Trump said. â€œPeople donâ€™t realize, you know, the Civil War â€?if you think about it, why? People donâ€™t ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?â€?It was not clear what Trump believed Jackson would have done to avert the 1861-65 conflict, which cost 620,000 lives. In a tweet later on Monday, Trump acknowledged that Jackson had died 16 years before the start of the war but said he â€œsaw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!â€?The events leading to the Civil War have been extensively researched, with slavery being one of the root causes. Slavery and its legacy have been a source of division in the United States since. By the time of his death, Jackson owned about 150 slaves who lived and worked at his plantation, the Hermitage. During his time in office, Jackson denounced the growing activity of abolitionists seeking an end to slavery. Trump and his supporters have likened his election victory to Jacksonâ€™s triumph in 1828, when Jackson became the first U.S. president from what was then the western frontier of Tennessee. The populist Democrat famously opened the White House to all comers after his inauguration, turning the normally dignified executive mansion into a mob scene. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0519,White House defends Trump invitation to Duterte despite human rights criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday defended President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to invite Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to Washington, saying his cooperation was needed to counter North Korea, even as the administration faced human rights criticism for its overture to Manila. Trump issued the invitation on Saturday night in what the White House said was a â€œvery friendlyâ€?phone conversation with Duterte, who is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines. â€œThere is nothing right now facing this country and facing the region that is a bigger threat than whatâ€™s happening in North Korea,â€? White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€?during a weekend in which Trump sought to firm up support in Southeast Asia to help rein in North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs. North Korea suggested on Monday it would continue its nuclear weapons tests, saying it will bolster its force â€œto the maximumâ€?in a â€œconsecutive and successive way at any momentâ€?in the face of what it calls U.S. aggression and hysteria. Priebus insisted the outreach to Duterte â€œdoesnâ€™t mean that human rights donâ€™t matter, but what it does mean is that the issues facing us developing out of North Korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row.â€?Since he came to power last year, Duterte has often sniped at Washington, his countryâ€™s longtime ally, has sought to mend relations with China and spoken of improving ties with Russia. Asked on Monday about his invitation from Trump, he was non-committal, telling reporters: â€œIâ€™m tied up. â€œI cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia and go to Israel,â€?he said, referring to already scheduled visits. Foreign Ministry spokesman Robespierre Bolivar said that once a formal letter of invitation came it would be accepted.  The  invitation for Duterte to the visit White House at an unspecified date appeared to be the latest example of the affinity Trump has shown for some foreign leaders with shaky human rights or autocratic reputations. For instance, he expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 presidential campaign, hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House and has had warm words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Trump is pressing to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor, North Korea. On Sunday, Trump also extended a White House invitation to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general who heads a military government that took power in a 2014 coup. Prayuthâ€™s administration had strained relations with Trumpâ€™s predecessor, Barack Obama. â€œCelebrating a man who boasts of killing his own citizens and inviting him to the White House, while remaining silent on his disgusting human rights record, sends a terrifying message,â€?said John Sifton, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch. â€œBy effectively endorsing Duterteâ€™s murderous â€˜war on drugsâ€? Trump has made himself morally complicit in future killings,â€?he said. A Trump administration official insisted, however, that the invitation was not a reward to Duterte or an endorsement of his policies but a decision that engagement with the Philippines was better than withdrawal which could â€œintensify bad behaviorâ€?by Duterte. â€œItâ€™s not a â€˜thank youâ€?â€?the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. â€œItâ€™s a meeting.â€?The official denied a New York Times report citing administration officials saying the State Department and the National Security Council were caught off-guard by the invitation to Duterte and were expected to object internally. â€œWe were not surprised. The guys who prepared for the call were unified on this,â€?the official said. Priebus made clear that North Korea was the top priority. â€œIf we donâ€™t have all of our folks together â€?whether theyâ€™re good folks, bad folks, people we wish would do better in their country, doesnâ€™t matter, weâ€™ve got to be on the same pageâ€?on North Korea, Priebus said. But taking a swipe at Trump for his invitation to Duterte,  Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy tweeted: â€œWe are watching in real time as the American human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash.â€?Thousands of Filipinos have been killed since Duterte unleashed his fierce anti-drugs campaign nearly 10 months ago. Police say they have killed only in self-defense, and the deaths of other drug dealers and users was down to vigilantes or narcotics gangs silencing potential witnesses. Human rights groups say official accounts are implausible and accuse Duterte of backing campaign of systematic extrajudicial killings by police. The government denies that. Duterte was infuriated by the Obama administrationâ€™s expressions of concern about extrajudicial killings after he took office last year and threatened to sever the long-standing U.S. defense alliance. Duterte spoke positively about Trump, a fellow populist, after the U.S. presidential election in November, and the new administration has sought ways to mend the alliance. In a summary of Saturdayâ€™s phone call between the two leaders, the White House said the two discussed â€œthe fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.â€?The White House statement included no criticism of Duterteâ€™s methods.

0520,"Budget deal may map U.S. Congress road ahead, via Trump bypass","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress, bitterly divided for years along party lines, may be mapping a bipartisan path forward that skirts around President Donald Trump when he refuses to engage constructively with lawmakers, Democrats and some lobbyists said on Monday. The path was discernible in a nearly $1.2 trillion federal spending deal carved out over the weekend to avert a government shutdown. It had Democratic fingerprints all over it, even though Republicans control Congress and the White House.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Trump will sign the 2017 budget bill when he receives it from Congress on Thursday or Friday. Trump, in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, said he was â€œvery happyâ€?with the deal announced late on Sunday. Democrats claimed victory on issue after issue in the agreement, which will keep the lights on in Washington through the end of  the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, provided it holds up and wins final approval as expected. Trump scored a partial win, getting a commitment for up to $15 billion in additional funding for a military buildup. That was about half of what he originally asked for. No money was included for Trumpâ€™s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democratic opposition to it was solid and support from Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans was soft. Mulvaney said Trump will seek wall funding in a budget proposal coming in late May. At a White House briefing, Mulvaney defended the concessions Trump made to reach an agreement, saying Democrats gave up on some items they had wanted as well in order to find a compromise. â€œEverything we got in this deal ... lines up perfectly with the presidentâ€™s priorities,â€?he said. Democrats took an opposite view. Describing the work on Capitol Hill that went into the temporary spending pact, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters: â€œDemocrats and Republicans in the House and Senate were closer to one another than we were to the president on so many of the different issues.â€?Schumer and Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said they were bolstered in negotiations by the fact that several Republican senators opposed funding for Trumpâ€™s wall and his call for deep domestic spending cuts. Schumer and Leahy said the White House never tried to work with Democrats in the process. Trump treats engaging with lawmakers on legislation as â€œan afterthought,â€?said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked in Congress as an aide to former House Republican leader Eric Cantor. â€œThe power of the Oval Office can provide a lot of leverage when trying to move something on Capitol Hill,â€?Heye said. â€œWe just havenâ€™t see that level of engagement from Trump, whether itâ€™s healthcare, or building a wall, or tax reform.â€?But John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said the spending bill may not be indicative of Trumpâ€™s ability to negotiate with Congress because the legislative body should have dealt with this yearâ€™s funding months ago and never have been allowed to go into the current year.  â€œHe knows that this bill was probably not going to reflect his priorities because it was old business,â€?Feehery said. â€œWhen it comes to new business, he has a lot more leverage in getting his priorities accomplished.â€?The spending deal preserved funding for healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which has drawn Republican ire because it performs abortions; for the Obamacare healthcare law; and for an array of environmental and other domestic programs Trump wanted to slash. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said because the legislation needs to win a supermajority of 60 votes in the 100-member Senate that cannot be achieved without Democratic support, â€œwe couldnâ€™t have our entire wayâ€?on the deal. Spicer said the â€œpresidentâ€™s priorities will be reflected much moreâ€?in spending yet to be worked out for the 2018 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. He said Trump was pleased to see the increase in military spending, a â€œdown paymentâ€?on border security and money for scholarships to help low-income children in Washington attend private schools.     The fiscal 2017 funds, which should have been locked into place seven months ago, would pay for federal programs from airport and border security operations to soldiersâ€?pay, medical research, foreign aid, space exploration and education. The Pentagon would win a $12.5 billion increase in defense spending for the fiscal year, with the possibility of an additional $2.5 billion contingent on Trump delivering a plan to Congress for defeating the Islamic State militant group. Congressional negotiators settled on $1.5 billion more for border security, including money for new technology and repairing existing infrastructure.  Under the deal, Puerto Rico would get an emergency injection of $295 million for its Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. The impoverished U.S. territory faces a severe Medicaid funding shortfall. The U.S. government and coal companies would be required to pay out healthcare to retired coal miners, guaranteeing benefits to workers even as coal companies face bankruptcy, under the spending agreement. The deal also would reimburse New York City for money spent securing Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0521,Maine governor sues state's attorney general in Trump policy tussle," (Please note: Story contains strong language in final paragraph) (Reuters) - Republican Maine Governor Paul LePage on Monday sued the stateâ€™s Democratic attorney general, contending she had abused her power by joining legal opposition to early moves by President Donald Trump that LePageâ€™s office supported. LePage, a fiery conservative now in his second term, challenged Attorney General Janet Mills for joining a legal brief opposing Trumpâ€™s executive order banning immigration from a half-dozen majority Muslim countries. The governor said he supported Trumpâ€™s order, which has been blocked by courts and which the White House says is necessary to protect national security. â€œIt is no secret that Attorney General Mills and I have differing political views, but that is not the issue,â€?LePage said in a statement. â€œThe problem is she has publicly denounced court cases which the executive branch has requested to join and subsequently refuses to provide legal representation for the state.â€?He said Mills had refused to represent the state in other cases where she disagreed with LePageâ€™s political position and prevented his office from filing its own brief in support of Trump, a charge that Mills denied. â€œInstead of signing onto another partyâ€™s brief at no cost to the taxpayers, however, or hiring a lawyer to draft his own brief, the governor has wasted state resources by hiring a lawyer to file a frivolous lawsuit, complaining that he cannot do exactly what we have told him he can do,â€?Mills said in a statement. Maine is the only one of the 50 U.S. states where the attorney general is elected by the state legislature, rather than elected by voters or appointed by the governor.      The nationâ€™s 22 Democratic attorneys general emerged in the first months of the Trump administration as a major opposition force to his policies, successfully suing to block his executive orders on travel and also challenging environmental policy moves. Maine is one of eight U.S. states that have a Republican governor and a Democratic attorney general, setting the stage for the conflict that resulted in Mondayâ€™s lawsuit, filed in Kennebec County Superior Court. LePage was first elected to office in 2010 on a wave of Tea Party support and was re-elected in 2014. Both victories came in three-way races.  He was an early supporter of Trump and came under intense public pressure last year after calling a Democratic lawmaker a â€œlittle son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker,â€?in a voicemail message that was widely circulated.

0523,White House seeks quick vote on healthcare overhaul but hurdles remain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top aides to President Donald Trump on Monday predicted the House of Representatives would move this week to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, though Republicans remained divided on how to protect sick Americans from insurance price hikes. The White House is eager to move forward on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, to make good on a key campaign promise. Republicans tried but failed to pass a replacement bill in March in an embarrassing setback for the Trump Administration. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions - provisions that force insurers to charge sick people and healthy people the same rates. It was unclear when or if a vote would be scheduled. Trump told Fox News Channel that he would not set a deadline for the vote, and indicated he was open to improvements. â€œWeâ€™re either going to have a great plan or Iâ€™m not signing it,â€?he said in the interview. In a separate interview with Bloomberg News, Trump insisted that the new bill would maintain protections for pre-existing conditions. â€œI want it to be good for sick people. Itâ€™s not in its final form right now,â€?he told Bloomberg. â€œIt will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.â€?Ten major patient advocacy groups said they opposed the reworked healthcare bill, including the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association. Other major medical groups such as the American Medical Association have also expressed concerns over coverage losses and unaffordable insurance for those with pre-existing conditions. Republican lawmakers have struggled to unite around legislation, with moderates and conservatives within the caucus divided over key provisions. Once a plan passes the Republican-controlled House, it is expected to face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower majority and where some party senators have expressed misgivings about the House bill. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn on Monday said in separate interviews with CBSâ€?â€œThis Morningâ€?that they thought there were enough votes to pass the bill this week. House Republican leaders were more cautious. As of Monday afternoon, no vote had been scheduled and backers of the healthcare proposal had not released legislative language. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican conference, said Republican members needed time to understand new tweaks to the bill. â€œWe are having those member-to-members conversations right now,â€?McMorris Rodgers told Fox News. Vice President Mike Pence made his way to Capitol Hill late on Monday to make the case to members who are on the fence, a Republican aide said on condition of anonymity, noting leaders are believed to be within five or six votes of having enough support to pass the bill. The Freedom Caucus, which brought down the previous effort to pass a healthcare bill, has endorsed the new measure. The Republican aide told Reuters all but one or two members of the group will support the reworked plan. â€œThis bill doesnâ€™t get all the way there but itâ€™s a good step and is ... the best we can get out of the House right now,â€?Representative Jim Jordan, chairman of the group, told CNN. But several moderate Republicans were either undecided or opposed the bill for fear that it would not protect those with pre-existing conditions and cause millions to lose health insurance. Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said he still had problems with the latest plan and suspected there were not enough votes to pass it. â€œToo many Americans are going to be without coverage,â€?Dent told MSNBC, adding that the plan could make things even worse for vulnerable Americans.

0524,"Few surprises for banks, financials in U.S. budget deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deal Congress is working to pass this week contains few surprises for the financial services industry, according to documents released by the House Appropriations Committee on Monday. Budget bills primarily lay out how government money can flow, but often also include riders - smaller measures attached to the budget so they can become law. During spending negotiations last week, Democrats said many of the riders would lead them to walk away from any budget deal, dubbing them â€œpoison pills.â€?The proposal unveiled on Monday was hailed for its bipartisan support. â€œIt is a solid bill that reflects our common values and that will help move our nation forward,â€?said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, the Republican chairman of the House appropriations committee. â€œOverall, the Democrats were successful at keeping the omnibus funding bill from being hijacked by inappropriate policy additions, keeping out over 160 proposed poison pill riders,â€?said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. The House of Representatives and Senate are expected to pass the $1 trillion spending bill that was unveiled on Monday before Friday.  Many on Capitol Hill and off had anticipated the bill would include a rider on how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is funded.  Currently, the agency receives its funding from the Federal Reserve, but Republicans have pushed to move the CFPB into the annual congressional budget, saying that would make it more accountable to voters. Instead, the deal was much lighter, only requiring the CFPB to report to Congress when it makes draws from the Fed. Democratic supporters of the CFPB, such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, say receiving funds from the Fed maintains the independence of the agency, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals from fraud. Warren was former President Barack Obamaâ€™s first choice to lead the CFPB, and the partyâ€™s â€œWarren Wing,â€?which includes the Banking Committeeâ€™s senior Democrat, Sherrod Brown, is committed to keeping it intact no matter the cost. â€œOpponents of the CFPB seem to realize that attempts to weaken the agency through the budget process could potentially derail a deal,â€?said Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB official. The deal also maintains a contentious rider from the last budget barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose their political donations. Democrats want major corporations to show to which candidates and causes they give money, and last year worked to  block two SEC commissioner nominations when the nominees would not support donation disclosures. Republicans say the disclosures are not material to investors. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1

He said that when Trump makes a budget request in late May for the 2018 fiscal year that begins in October, he will include a request for money to build the wall, which is a top priority of the president. Mulvaney said the short-term spending bill that Trump would  sign did not have everything Trump wanted but contained a significant increase for defense the president requested.

0527,New Jersey's Christie vetoes bill seeking Trump's tax returns,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Monday vetoed a bill that would have required President Donald Trump to release his tax returns in order to run for re-election in the state, calling it â€œpolitics at its worst.â€?The Democrat-controlled state legislature had passed the bill in March in response to Trumpâ€™s refusal to make public his tax returns when he ran for president as a Republican last year. Under the law, any candidate for president or vice president could not appear on the ballot without releasing at least five years of returns. Before Trump, every major presidential candidate had done so voluntarily since the 1970s. Christie, who became one of Trumpâ€™s earliest high-profile backers after his own White House run fizzled and served on Trumpâ€™s transition team, said the legislation was an unconstitutional â€œform of therapyâ€?for Democrats unwilling to accept Trumpâ€™s win over Democrat Hillary Clinton. â€œThe hypocrisy and false outrage underlying this bill is stunning - even by Trenton standards,â€?he said in a statement accompanying the veto. New Jersey was the first of at least 20 states considering similar legislation to send a bill to its governorâ€™s desk for consideration. The chairman of the state assemblyâ€™s judiciary committee, Democrat John McKeon, called Christieâ€™s comments â€œgrandstanding and childish rhetoric.â€?â€œThis much is clear â€?Governor Christie is obsessed with protecting and showing allegiance to President Trump,â€?McKeon added in a statement. â€œSad!â€?The state Senate majority leader, Democrat Loretta Weinberg, said voters â€œdeserve to know what financial ties and interests candidates for the presidency and vice presidency have, including with other countries.â€?Trumpâ€™s critics have said his tax returns represent the only way to assess any potential conflicts of interest related to his sprawling business empire. Democrats have also suggested the returns could reveal politically damaging information, such as Trumpâ€™s possible use of loopholes to avoid paying income taxes. During the campaign, Trump said he would not release the returns because he was being audited, and the White House has made it clear he has no intention of doing so after winning the election.

0528,"Mnuchin sees U.S. growth reaching 3 percent in time, tax cuts to help","BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that economic growth of three percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes.  Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, almost a week after he helped unveil plans to cut taxes for many people and corporations to 15 percent, Mnuchin said tax reform and regulatory relief will help spur economic growth. Mnuchinâ€™s comments also come days after government data showed tepid economic growth of 0.7 percent for the last three months. â€œThe tax plan is our version of a jobs bill,â€?Mnuchin said in an onstage interview with journalist Maria Bartoromo. Although the stock market has reacted positively to Trumpâ€™s election - with the S&P 500 index up 11 percent since November - critics of the tax plan have said it is ambitious and lacks details.  In a light-hearted moment, Mnuchin quipped that many at the conference had him to thank for the surge in bank stocks that have helped lift their portfolios, bringing laughter from the audience. But with few fresh details about Trumpâ€™s plans and an uncertain time frame, some at the conference expressed concern that the generally optimistic atmosphere might begin to fade. â€œIâ€™m concerned that if we donâ€™t see tax or healthcare reform by the end of the year, markets will start to doubt the administrationâ€™s ability to deliver it,â€?said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners.  Mnuchin said he has been working with congressional leaders to push tax reform and he hopes for bi-partisan support.  Mnuchin told CNBC on the sidelines of the conference that the tax proposal was purposely vague so that the administration could work with legislators to craft something that will pass Congress. The Trump administration has invited many business leaders into the White House and is listening closely to their concerns and hopes on tax changes, he added.  David Solomon, president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, said the great sense of optimism early in Trumpâ€™s tenure may be fading some. â€œThis quarter it feels like conviction for tax and regulatory reform is more muted.â€?Solomonâ€™s predecessor at Goldman, Gary Cohn, joined the Trump administration as director of the National Economic Council and one of his primary goals has been to work on tax reform. One concern associated with the Trump tax plan is how the government plans to pay for it. Mnuchin said that there are plenty of other ways to off set the revenue that would be lost through reduced tax receipts. He did not offer many specifics. Indeed many at the conference, including investment managers whose businesses could benefit dramatically from the cut in taxes, were cheering the new administration and its can-do attitude which also includes plans to tackle health care reform. Prospects for growth look to be better around the world, several said. Yet there were also some rumblings of concern that ambitious projects would not be completed and that tensions around the world with other governments would increase. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said that optimism is off the charts according to the stock market but geopolitical issues are a real concern.

0529,Congress to fund more detention beds despite drop in border crossings,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Congress has agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for illegal immigrants, the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said on Monday, less than half the number requested by President Donald Trump. The additional detention space was negotiated by Republican leaders with Democrats as part of a spending package Congress will vote on later this week to fund the government through September, according to two congressional sources familiar with the agreement.  The new beds will be added despite a sharp decline last month in apprehensions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. Immigration detention centers at the U.S. border have been operating at below capacity in recent months. The agreement will increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the presidentâ€™s goal of â€œenhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending â€˜catch and releaseâ€?for those apprehended at the border.â€?  The budget summary did not break out the specific cost of the additional 5,300 beds, but said they would be included in an overall $1.5 billion increase in immigration enforcement funding.  The spending also includes more electronic monitoring and GPS tracking alternatives to detention, as well 100 additional officers to enforce immigration laws and funding for programs that increase coordination with local authorities on immigration enforcement. Â  A spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which runs detention facilities, said the agency would not comment on the contents of the spending bill while the legislation is pending. The House Appropriations Committee did not respond to a request for comment.  From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE.  If border crossings and apprehensions continue to stay low, the administration could struggle to fill additional detention beds, unless it increases â€œarrests of undocumented immigrants in the interior with no criminal convictions and cuts back on releases of asylum seekers found to have legitimate claims,â€?said Kevin Landy, who served as assistant director at ICE during the Obama administration. Â Â Â  â€œICE is going to be under enormous pressure to fill those bedsâ€?to prove to Congress that the funding was needed, said Landy, who left his post in January. Democrats raised similar concerns during budget negotiations, a Congressional aide with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters.  Some Republicans as well as Democrats also expressed worries during the negotiations that the Department of Homeland Security might redirect money allotted for detention centers to use on border wall construction if Congress appropriated more money than needed, the aide said.  In October, the first month of the 2017 fiscal year, 66,710 people were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Apprehensions have fallen steadily since then. Â   In March, 16,600 individuals were apprehended, down 64 percent from the year-earlier month, according to statistics from Customs and Border Patrol. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0530,U.S. Congress to give Puerto Rico short-term Medicaid help,"(Reuters) - Ailing Puerto Rico would receive $295 million in Medicaid funding from the federal government as part of the U.S. Congressâ€?spending plan to avert a government shutdown, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Monday.  Rossello said in a statement in Spanish that he was â€œgratefulâ€?for the addition in the spending bill reached late Sunday night.  The full House of Representatives and Senate must approve the bipartisan pact, though prompt passage was expected this week. Puerto Ricoâ€™s public health system is nearly insolvent, a key driver of emigration that has decimated the U.S. territoryâ€™s population as it wrestles with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and unemployment twice the U.S. average. The island faces a deadline at midnight Monday to negotiate a debt-cutting agreement with creditors, or open itself up to lawsuits over debt defaults. It could also file for a modified version of U.S. bankruptcy to protect itself from such litigation. One creditor, who owns insured Puerto Rican bonds, said the proposal was â€œnot even close to a good proposal. â€œNot just lowball but also not a well constructed proposal,â€?said Sean Burgess, portfolio manager and lead trader for Puerto Rico strategy at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors. The islandâ€™s aggressive lobbying for federal healthcare funding in Washington is seen as a possible detractor to filing bankruptcy, which would not garner sympathy from Congressional Republicans who opposed the in-court restructuring provision in last yearâ€™s Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA. The $295 million will help fund the islandâ€™s Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, which starts July 1, and enable Puerto Rico to contract with managed care health insurance companies that administer the Medicaid program.  Without the money, the island would have to run the Medicaid program on its own, a massive undertaking that Puerto Rico is not equipped to do, said island Health Secretary Dr. Rafael RodrÃ­guez-Mercado. But Puerto Rico will still need an additional $300 million to fund its entire Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, RodrÃ­guez-Mercado told Reuters in an interview on Monday. He hopes that money will come from the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in September. Puerto Ricoâ€™s $2.76 billion Medicaid budget has been funded in part by a one-time pool of money provided to U.S. territories under the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.  That money is expected to run out by the end of 2017, triggering what island officials call the â€œMedicaid cliffâ€?â€?the return to a federal funding cap of $321 million for Puerto Ricoâ€™s Medicaid program. U.S. territories receive proportionately less federal Medicaid reimbursement than U.S. states. Prior to Obamacare, Puerto Rico partially funded its Medicaid budget through bonds, exacerbating the islandâ€™s debt crisis.  In recent weeks, Governor Ricardo Rossello has been lobbying to boost Puerto Ricoâ€™s healthcare funding, warning that Washingtonâ€™s failure to do so would leave some 900,000 people without health coverage.

0533,Trump says open to raising gasoline tax to fund infrastructure: Bloomberg,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he would consider raising the federal tax on gasoline to fund infrastructure development, Bloomberg News reported. â€œItâ€™s something that I would certainly consider,â€?Trump told the news agency in an interview on Monday. â€œThe truckers have said that they want me to do something as long as that money is earmarked to highways.â€?The Trump administration released an outline of a tax plan last week that would slash tax rates for businesses and reduce the number of tax brackets for individuals. The plan, however, was silent on gasoline taxes, a potentially delicate issue given the widespread impact any increase would have on U.S. households. Trump told Bloomberg his tax proposal was just an opening gambit in a negotiation with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. â€œEverything is a starting point,â€?he said, according to Bloomberg, adding that he was willing to give up on aspects of his plan. He declined to specify where he would yield. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0534,Afghans who helped U.S. forces get more visas under funding bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An extra 2,500 visas for Afghans who assisted American forces during the war in their country will be granted under the $1 trillion U.S. government funding deal reached on Sunday, preserving a program that had been at risk of shutting down. The spending deal agreed by congressional negotiators  continued the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, which allows Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, often risking their lives, to move to the United States after a rigorous vetting process. A recent bi-partisan push by U.S. lawmakers for more SIV visas came against the backdrop of efforts by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to clamp down on immigration from majority Muslim countries, an effort that has been blocked by the courts. In March, the U.S. embassy in Kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for SIV applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, even though 1,500 more were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in late 2016. That helped prompt a group of senators, including Republican Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain to seek more.  As of April 20, only 780 SIV visas remained available, while more than 14,000 Afghans had already begun the application progress, according to the U.S. State Department. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a long-time advocate for the SIV program, said letting it lapse would have sent a message that the United States was willing to abandon its supporters. â€œItâ€™s both a moral and practical imperative that Congress approve additional visas. Thousands of Afghans have put themselves, and their families, at risk to help our soldiers and diplomats accomplish the U.S. mission and return home safely,â€?Shaheen said in an emailed statement.  Afghanistan is not one of the six countries whose citizens would have been barred under Trumpâ€™s executive order, but some of the presidentâ€™s fellow Republicans in Congress have resisted expanding the SIV program out of concern that militants could use it to enter the United States. Supporters of the program say such concerns are overblown, noting the intensity of the screening to which applicants are subjected. ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0535,U.S. Congress secures health benefits for coal miners,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government and coal companies will be required to pay out healthcare to retired coal miners, guaranteeing benefits to workers even as coal companies face bankruptcy, after Congress on Sunday reached a fiscal spending agreement for 2017.   The provision to secure the United Mine Workersâ€?healthcare benefits was included in a deal that lawmakers reached late on Sunday for around $1 trillion in federal funding that would avert a government shutdown later this week. Around 22,600 coal miners and their families were on the brink of losing on April 30 their healthcare benefits, which were at risk of default as the industry struggled, with companies trying to recover from bankruptcies. â€œThis permanent solution to protect these benefits is a victory for our miners, their families, and their widows,â€?said Congressman Evan Jenkins, a West Virginia Republican who represents the stateâ€™s coal-producing counties. Members of the UMWA have made several visits to Washington over the last few months to urge lawmakers to protect their benefits, which they say is a government obligation. President Harry Truman in 1946 brokered the Krug-Lewis agreement, which guaranteed health and pension benefits for coal miners. Sundayâ€™s agreement did not address a long-term fix for minersâ€?pension funds, which are also set to be terminated.    Lawmakers from both parties still hope to pass the Miners Protection Act, which would transfer funds from the Abandoned Mine Land fund to the unionâ€™s pension plan to prevent its insolvency. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has been working with the UMWA  and Democratic and Republican lawmakers to pass that bill. If Congress cannot transfer those funds, the financially-strained $5 billion federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, an agency that backstops failed private-sector pension programs, would be responsible for covering the plans. Manchin said there is a â€œsacred bond between worker and countryâ€?and that he â€œis more determined than ever to fulfill our whole obligation and secure retired miners pension benefits as well.â€?

0536,Trump won't trade U.S. jobs for China's help on North Korea: Ross,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump does not intend to trade away U.S. jobs for Chinaâ€™s help on North Korea, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday, adding that there were â€œconstructiveâ€?talks with Beijing underway on trade issues. In an interview with CNBC, Ross rowed back from Trumpâ€™s comments in a CBS interview on Saturday that Chinaâ€™s help on North Korea â€œtrumps trade.â€? Asked if the need for Chinaâ€™s help to contain threats from North Korea had made it more difficult to be tough with Beijing on trade issues, Ross said he did not think so. â€œWeâ€™ve been having some very constructive discussions on trade with the Chinese in parallelâ€?to discussions on North Korea, Ross told CNBC. â€œI think what the president was trying to say is that weâ€™re trying to have an overall constructive relationship with China on a variety of topics, the most pressing of which, because it directly involves human lives, is the North Korea situation. I donâ€™t think he meant to indicate at all that he intends to trade away American jobs just for help on North Korea,â€?Ross said. Ross also reaffirmed that the administration intended to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, not withdraw from it. He called NAFTA â€œan ancient treatyâ€?that does nothing to address the digital economy, very little to address services, and has many â€œobsoleteâ€?provisions, such as those on rules of origin, allowing in too many components and products from outside the United States, Canada and Mexico. He said, however, Mexicoâ€™s July 2018 national elections could become an obstacle if negotiations were not completed well before then. â€œThe closer we get to the election, the more difficult it will be to get anything through,â€?Ross said.   Asked about White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarroâ€™s role in trade policy, Ross said he was â€œnot a trade negotiator,â€?but was working with the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Commerce Department as â€œa kind of triumvirateâ€?on trade. Ross added that Navarro was spending a lot of time on â€œBuy American, Hire Americanâ€?initiatives as part of his focus on U.S. trade deficits.   Trump created the role for Navarro after he served as the principal economic advisor to his 2016 election campaign.     ",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1
0537,Trump signs executive order to modernize U.S. government info tech,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Monday he has signed an executive order creating a new technology council to â€œtransfer and modernizeâ€?the U.S. governmentâ€™s information technology systems. A White House official confirmed Monday that about 20 technology chief executives will attend meetings at the White House in early June to talk about improving government information technology. â€œAmericans deserve better digital services from their Government. To effectuate this policy, the federal government must transform and modernize its information technology and how it uses and delivers digital services,â€?Trumpâ€™s executive order dated April 28 said. Trump has held a number of meetings with top tech chief executives since becoming president, including Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, IBM Corp, Microsoft Inc, and Tesla Inc. In March, Trump signed a separate order to overhaul the federal government. Trump tapped Jared Kushner in March to lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions as the White House pushes to shrink government, cut federal employees and eliminate regulations. Officially called the American Technology Council, Chris Liddell will be its director. He is the White House director of strategic initiatives, and former Microsoft and General Motors co chief financial officer. A 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report publicly estimated the U.S. government spends more than $80 billion in IT annually, but said spending has fallen by $7.3 billion since 2010. In 2015, there were at least 7,000 separate IT investments by the U.S. government, the report said. The $80 billion figure does not include Defense Department classified IT systems; and 58 independent executive branch agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the report said.  The GAO report said U.S. government IT investments â€œare becoming increasingly obsolete: many use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported.â€?The report found some agencies are using systems that have components that are at least 50 years old. â€œThe Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nationâ€™s nuclear forces,â€?the report said. The report said the Defense Department plans to update the system by the end of September. The Treasury Departmentâ€™s business master file of tax data pertaining to individual business income taxpayers dates back to the 1950s and using an antiquated computer language â€œand operates on an IBM mainframe.â€?The council is chaired by Trump and includes the defense secretary, homeland security secretary, budget director and director of national intelligence.

0538,Federal spending plan reimburses New York City for Trump security,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal spending agreement reached late on Sunday will reimburse New York City for money spent securing U.S. President Donald Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Altogether, New York City and other state and local governments that have hosted the president would receive $61 million in the latest federal budget deal. Officials in Floridaâ€™s Palm Beach County, home to Trumpâ€™s private club Mar-a-Lago, have also asked for help in paying security costs. â€œWe are getting what we are owed,â€?Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement on Monday. â€œThatâ€™s good news for our city and the hardworking police officers faced with this unprecedented security challenge.â€?He and Police Commissioner James Oâ€™Neill worked for several months with New Yorkâ€™s congressional delegation to have the funds included in the deal, he said. Congress is expected to approve the legislation by the end of the week. The deal includes $20 million for costs incurred between Election Day in November and Inauguration Day in January, as well as $41 million after Trump was sworn in. The funding, which must be shared with other local governments, is on top of the $7 million allocated last fall.     The city spends on average $127,000 to $146,000 a day for the New York Police Department to protect First Lady Melania Trump and the coupleâ€™s young son when President Trump is not in town. Those costs are expected to swell to a daily average of $308,000 when Trump is in the city, the mayorâ€™s office said. Their home atop the 58-story skyscraper on Fifth Avenue near Central Park is the site of regular protests and is in an area popular with tourists. When outlining his $84.9 billion executive city budget for fiscal 2018 on Wednesday, de Blasio said the city normally handles occasional visits from Presidents, but not ongoing costs to keep the First Family secure in Trump Tower. â€œWeâ€™re not budgeting for something thatâ€™s a federal responsibility,â€?he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. â€œIt is ridiculous to expect local law enforcement... to bear the extraordinary and ongoing costs of protecting the President of the United States,â€?Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who helped lead the stateâ€™s congressional delegation in making the reimbursement request, said in a statement on Monday.

0539,Asian nations pulled into China's orbit as Trump puts America first,"MANILA (Reuters) - Across Asia, more and more countries are being pulled into Beijingâ€™s orbit, with the timid stance adopted by Southeast Asian nations on the South China Sea at a weekend summit a clear sign this fundamental geostrategic shift is gathering momentum. U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s flurry of calls at the weekend to the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore might cheer those who fear his predecessor Barack Obamaâ€™s â€œpivotâ€?to Asia has been abandoned in favor of an â€œAmerica Firstâ€?agenda. But White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the conversations were aimed at lining up Asian partners in case tensions over North Korea lead to â€œnuclear and massive destruction in Asiaâ€? and mentioned no broader strategic goal. Southeast Asian nations will need more than that to convince them the United States still has their backs. In the meantime, some are leaning closer to China, soft-pedalling quarrels over the disputed South China Sea and angling for a slice of Beijingâ€™s â€œOne Belt, One Roadâ€?infrastructure investment program to compensate for the U.S. abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. The unexpected bonhomie that has emerged between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could give Asian countries further confidence to continue their swing toward Beijing. â€œBefore, most Southeast Asian states wanted to benefit from Chinese regional economic initiatives and from American pushback against China,â€?said Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. â€œThe second part of this balance is now in question. Hence, the pressure to acquiesce to China diplomatically and on security issues is stronger.â€?Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, piqued by the Obama administrationâ€™s criticism of his human rights record, last year announced his â€œseparationâ€?from longtime ally the United States while on a visit to Beijing. The White House described Trumpâ€™s conversation with the firebrand Philippines leader as â€œvery friendlyâ€?and - prompting criticism from Human Rights Watch for â€œeffectively endorsing Duterteâ€™s murderous war on drugsâ€?- invited him to Washington. But, underlining his new-found friendship with Beijing, Duterte on Monday inspected a Chinese naval ships docked at his hometown, the first visit of its kind to the Philippines in years. Duterte, who last year put aside a legal challenge to Beijingâ€™s sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea to start negotiating billions of dollars worth of loans and infrastructure investments, chaired the latest summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Manila. Several ASEAN diplomats said China sent officials to lobby the Philippines ahead of the summit, and before the leaders had even gathered Duterte said it was pointless pressuring Beijing over its maritime activities. An early draft of the summit statement seen by Reuters made references to land reclamation and militarization in the disputed waterway, but they were subsequently dropped, as were references to â€œtensionsâ€?and â€œescalation of activitiesâ€?  Cook said it was clear that, with the Philippines steering the summit to this conclusion, â€œit is no longer just Cambodia that is acting as an agent of Chinese influence in ASEAN over the South China Sea disputeâ€? Thailand and Malaysia have also moved closer to China. Thailandâ€™s relations with Washington came under strain during the Obama administration because of concerns about freedoms under its military-dominated government. Trump invited Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to visit Washington during their call on Sunday, but the former generalâ€™s government has its eyes elsewhere: last week it approved the first of three submarine purchases from China worth more than $1 billion. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says Washingtonâ€™s new posture has shifted Asiaâ€™s political and economic balance. Lee, whose country, like Vietnam, has shown no signs of moving closer to Beijing, stressed to his ASEAN counterparts on Saturday that, despite Trumpâ€™s â€œradically different approachâ€? they should balance their ties between the United States and China. Trump has said he will attend two summits in the region in November. But Southeast Asian nations are trying to gauge how far they can still rely on Washington as a shield against Chinese assertiveness. ASEAN foreign ministers will be seeking answers at a meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington this Thursday. Uncertainty over Washingtonâ€™s commitment, analysts say, will only draw ASEAN countries further toward China, which can lure them with cheap loans, infrastructure investments and tariff cuts, but with a risk of diminished bargaining power. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkokâ€™s Chulalongkorn University, said it was imperative for ASEAN to regain leverage by bringing Washington back into the equation and expanding the influence of Japan. â€œASEAN is in a precarious position now with the concessions, accommodation and even appeasement with China,â€?Thitinan said.    â€œIf China continues to be shrewd and takes ASEAN on another ride, then ASEAN will be much worse off.â€?",politicsNews,2017/5/1,1

0546,BOMBSHELL CASE: Illegal Alien Voting Cover-Up Exposed as Virginia Governor Blamed for Thousands Casting Ballots,"Thank goodness for President Trump s new commission because the latest finding on voter fraud is just the tip of the voter fraud iceberg:HERE S WHAT S GOING ON:When Maureen Erickson registered to vote in Prince William County, she listed her home address as a street in Guatemala, in what should have been a very strong indication that she wasn t a regular Virginia resident. Yet she remained on the voting rolls for years, and even cast ballots in 14 different elections, up through the 2008 presidential contest. She was only purged in 2012, just ahead of the election, after she self-reported as a noncitizen, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Public Interest Legal Foundation. Ms. Erickson was one of more than 5,500 noncitizens who were registered to vote in Virginia this decade, and were only bumped from the rolls after they admitted to being ineligible. Some 1,852 of them even managed to cast ballots that were likely illegal, though undetected, the PILF, a conservative voter integrity group, said in its report. Just as troubling, the PILF said, was Virginia s efforts to try to hide the information from the public   a problem foundation President J. Christian Adams said began at the very top, with Gov. Terry McAuliffe.  At the instruction of Governor McAuliffe s political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open,  Mr. Adams said in a statement releasing the report.  From NoVa to Norfolk and all urban and rural points in between, alien voters are casting ballots with practically no legal consequences in response.  READ MORE: WTNEW REPORT:A new report released shortly after the forming of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity finds that more than 5,000 individuals were determined to be non-U.S. citizens registered to vote in Virginia. Dubbed a  sequel  to a similar 2016 effort, the latest study found 5,556 voters were  quietly removed  from the records for reasons related to non-citizenship  between 2011 and May 2017,  according to an advanced look at the findings provided by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). Of the total registered, one-third of unlawful voters managed to cast ballots leading to a total of more than 7,400 illegal votes cast, according to the report.The organization points out that it was unable to find any evidence that illegal registrations or votes were ever prosecuted.The report details how ineligible individuals are slowly discovered by local officials most often, the authors allege, by accident. Applicants for voter registration are not required to prove they are actual U.S. citizens in Virginia. The vast majority of states only require that people claim to be citizens during registration, PILF notes. The report details, however, that Virginia shares information when a claimed citizen indicates otherwise to a separate state agency. At that point, removal procedures begin:In the absence of regular data-sharing arrangements between federal officials and the Commonwealth, the ability of election officials to identify aliens on the voter rolls is almost nonexistent.The most that happens in Virginia is that an alien on the voter rolls will sometimes tell the state DMV they are not a citizen. Without those leads, counties and municipalities must accept false claims of citizenship on their face.The authors also shared with this reporter examples of how some ineligible noncitizens admitted their immigration statuses at the outset, but were still registered to vote. Some illegal registrants lasted on the rolls for years risking possible deportation until they were discovered.Read more: Breitbart",politics,2017/5/31,0

FIRST LADY MELANIA Makes Classy, Yet Blistering Response To Kathy Griffinâ€™s ISIS Inspired Photo Of Decapitated President Trump","Social media erupted yesterday when outspoken comedian Kathy Griffin, posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields where she held a bloodied, decapitated mask of President Trump.Today, Melania Trump questioned Kathy Griffin s mental health in a blistering statement after she posted a photo of her holding a bloodied, decapitated version of President Trump s head.The video posted on Twitter of Griffin holding the decapitated head of President Trump has since been removed. As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,  the first lady said in a statement Wednesday.  When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.   Daily CallerPresident Trump took to Twitter to respond to the unbelievably vile comedian Kathy Griffin. Trump s tweet also reminded Griffin that he has an 11-year old son who has the ability to see her disgusting depiction of his father s bloodied, decapitated head:Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.

0548,"RUSH LIMBAUGH: This Group is â€œRoadblockingâ€?Trump More Than Any Other With Approval of Over 75,000 Refugees This Year!","Rush Limbaugh nails it in the transcript below but the most disturbing part of the  roadblocking  of Trump is that the refugee resettlement program is to be funded/ expanded  by Congress for fiscal year 2018 and there is  a desire for over 75,000 refugees from mostly Muslim countries THIS year:Republicans in Congress funded the US Refugee Admissions Program at a level for 75,000 refugees to be admitted by September 30th (the last day of this fiscal year):U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a  further expansion  through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added.We ve immigrated mostly Muslim refugees since 9/11!Pew: More Muslims Than Christians by 2100Why are we continuing down this path when it s a better solution to keep them in safe zones in their own country? This solution was even proposed by President Trump! Small towns across America are being forever changed by the HUGE influx of Muslims. Please see our latest on this below the Rush Limbaugh transcript.Rush Limbaugh let it rip on the Republicans yesterday with his concern that it s the Republicans who are  roadblocking  the Trump agenda:Transcript:I don t understand how people don t get that it s not just the Democrats in Washington that are roadblocking Trump. I mentioned it earlier.Mitch McConnell says he can t see a way to getting 50 votes for the House Obamacare repeal bill? Now, stop and think here, folks. Back when the only element that we had was the House of Representatives and Republican voters were constantly saying,  Why aren t you doing more to stop Obama? Why aren t you trying to do something to stop Obamacare?  The answer was always,  Well, all we ve got is the House. W-w-we can t get anything through the Senate because the Democrats own the Senate. Obama s in the White House! He ll veto anything if it did make it there. So voters gave Republicans the Senate, and Mitch McConnell said,  Well, the first thing you have to know is it takes 60 votes to do anything in the Senate, and we don t have 60 votes. We only have 52.  And then he would add,  Plus, as long as Obama s still in the White House, all this is academic anyway. He s gonna veto whatever we pass.  So we gave the Republicans the White House and elected Trump. Now the latest story  There s a Wall Street Journal story. You know, I had this sort of cram last night after getting back from being away two days.I saw a Wall Street Journal story about how the Republicans in the House, they just can t! It s just impossible. They re pulling their hair out. They don t know what to do. They just can t find a way to cut any taxes. Because every time they cut a tax over here, they have to find a way to make the money up over there, and they just can t. They re looking at all these various tax cuts proposals and they said,  I   I   I don t know how we re gonna pay for all this. So the Republican Party, which is ostensibly the party of the president   and they owe their majority to him, particularly the Senate   are roadblocking Donald Trump more than the Democrats are, because the Democrats cannot. The Democrats don t have the votes in the House to stop Trump. The Democrats don t have the votes in the Senate to stop Trump, although there is the 60-vote cloture requirement. It s not the Democrats standing up and saying,  We are not gonna help. We re gonna stand in the way of any foolish tax cut you propose. It s the Republicans standing up and saying,  I just don t see how we re   there s no room here. I don t know how we re gonna lower rates when you have this exemption over here and you have this exemption there.  And I just read this stuff and I shake my head. They don t want to cut taxes. Either they don t want to cut taxes institutionally, they don t want to cut taxes economically, or they just don t want to do the heavy lifting. I don t know what it is. My guess is they don t want to help Trump.Now, you would think Trump figures this out, but he doesn t give any evidence of it. Like he tweeted something:  U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes immediately and get health care and tax cuts approved fast and easy. Democrats would do it no doubt.  He s talking about getting rid of the 60-vote requirement to shut off debate and just go to simple majority on every bill. Does he know that it s the Republicans that are the roadblock here? He has to know, and certainly if he s got people around him who know.Now, I could understand if he doesn t want to go public and start an internecine battle between the White House and the Republicans on Capitol Hill, you know, keep that for back channels and behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal had a picture of the chairman of Ways and Means Committee and Paul Ryan standing there and all these guys and the headline:  Republicans Find Yet Another Way to Cut Taxes on the Rich. They just don t see how they can do it. It s incredible. It really is incredible. Because, of course, there s a way. They just don t want to do it. I think it s all establishment, all the time anti-Trump, throw the media in there as well. But even in the middle of this I can tell you almost assuredly that Trump is not off his game. He s not despondent. He s not sitting there worried about why all these people hate him. He s not worried about all that. He s just head down and moving ahead full speed as he can, not reacting or responding to all this stuff in the media, except when he tweets.REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT CONTINUES! Congress approved funding for the refugee resettlement program! This is NOT good news and is shocking to see that they are keeping the pipeline going on bringing mostly Muslim refugees to America. You have to ask why they continue to ignore this failed boondoggle that the American taxpayers fund each year:It is because most of them work for their big business donors and the Chamber of Commerce to guarantee a steady supply of cheap immigrant labor! Adding insult to injury, your tax dollars support refugee families through the welfare system because wages are too low! You pay for the importation of the labor and for the laborers  support once here!It is really quite a difficult obstacle for us (who wish to see the USRAP reformed) to overcome big businesses and global corporations pushing cheap labor in conjunction with so-called  religious  charities (paid by taxpayers!) claiming this is all about humanitarianism while essentially acting as  head hunters  for big business.Here s HuffPo s latest on the pipeline flowing:The United States appears to be resuming its longstanding efforts to resettle refugees after the program was derailed and almost completely upended abroad for several months.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday.

0550,WINNING! GEORGE SOROS Group Gets Black Eye When Hannity Advertiser Comes Back After Allegedly Pulling Ads Over Seth Rich Story,"The USAA financial services firm is reinstating its advertising on Sean Hannity s Fox News Channel program after receiving heavy criticism for its initial decision from many of the military members and veterans that it serves.The San Antonio, Texas-based company said Tuesday it will also start advertising again on other programs where it had suspended ads, including  Hardball  and  The Rachel Maddow Show  on MSNBC, and Jake Tapper s  The Lead  on CNN.Following Hannity s reporting on (what the AP calls a discredited conspiracy theory) involving the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member, the liberal advocacy group Media Matters last week posted a list of his show s advertisers   and USAA was one of 10 to say it was pulling its commercials. At the time, the USAA said the company s policy was to avoid politically opinionated shows.But many of USAA s customers reacted angrily, and it didn t help when the company s advertising on other opinion shows was pointed out.USAA said it wasn t trying to favor one set of political views over another. We heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs,  USAA said in a statement on Tuesday.  Our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from USAA s well-known commitment to service. Today, the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred. The advertising is returning while the company reviews its policy about avoiding the opinion shows.Hannity was due to return to Fox Tuesday following a brief vacation. He had said he would no longer talk about the shooting death of Seth Rich last year following pleas from the man s family, although his network had retracted an online story about Rich because it hadn t met its reporting standards.Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said he wasn t surprised by USAA s decision,  given the avalanche  of protests. His group was behind mobilizing that backlash, and said its members generated more than 1,600 phone calls to USAA within 48 hours. AP",politics,2017/5/31,0

0555,WHY ITâ€™S GOOD NEWS For Conservatives That Bitter Hillary Canâ€™t Shut Up About Losing [VIDEO],"As a Wellesley graduate, I was shocked and dismayed by Hillary Clinton s commencement address. Actually, that is #FakeNews. I was neither shocked nor dismayed by Mrs. Clinton s speech (but I did graduate from Wellesley   with honors!) It was exactly the kind of self-pitying, leaden and all-about-me performance that I would have expected from the entitled former Democrat candidate and now sore loser.Watch a few of Hillary s greatest hits during her commencement speech at Wellesley College:Also, it revealed this: Hillary hasn t learned a thing. As her friend Mike Bloomberg recently told an audience of Harvard Business School grads   Hillary lost the election because she had absolutely no message. She still doesn t.In addition, she is utterly lacking in self-awareness. She spoke at length about what she sees as a  full-fledged assault on truth and reason,  telling the graduating seniors that  the future of America, indeed the future of the world, depends on brave, thoughtful people like you insisting on truth and integrity right now every day.  This, from a woman who ran for our nation s highest office while distrusted by nearly two-thirds of the country, with good reason.As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.In her remarks, Hillary criticized  people    aka Trump followers, presumably   on social media for  sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,  and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech.Did she ever consider that there might be families in the audience who voted for her opponent? That they might not enjoy her taking veiled potshots at President Trump, and that this was their daughters  day too?Echoing the liberal media, Hillary went after President Trump through innuendo and clich s, talking about the dangers of fomenting fear and of  alternative facts.  Good thing there was no Q&A; someone might have wanted further clarification of how she came under sniper fire in Bosnia, or how a video caused the Benghazi attack or how the Monica Lewinsky scandal stemmed from a  vast right-wing conspiracy  and not Bill Clinton s unruly libido.Hillary trod dangerous pathways as she remarked,  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.  She is correct, of course, but a cursory review of her multiple dodges and lies about her mishandling of classified information and efforts to destroy evidence reveals a woman who fully earned her low trustworthiness ratings from Americans.The election is over, but Hillary cannot let it go. This is good news for Republicans. As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity at Wellesley. She could have delivered a message of unity, and helped our anxious country begin to heal. Her followers need to see her putting country above politics; they need to see her as she briefly appeared at the inauguration, supporting the peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. Apparently, that is just too heavy a lift for Mrs. Clinton. She is happier nursing her wounds, and continuing to inflict them on the country.The former First Lady could also have talked about the dramatic changes taking place in our economy, and how women are thriving as entrepreneurs. She could have talked about the founders of Rent the Runway, or Sarah Blakely, who created Spanx, or Essie Weingarten, who bet her life s savings on a new idea and created a nail polish empire sold to L Oreal in 2010. These women are inspirational; they didn t shatter glass ceilings, they ignored them. It is true we need women in politics, and running NGOs, but we also need women making money and boosting the economy. That s where the funding for free college tuition and refugee services comes from   a lesson Hillary may never have learned.The New York Times tells us that the students cheered Mrs. Clinton  thunderously.  Of course they did. They have been weaned on courses like  Love and Intimacy  in the Women s and Gender Studies department or  Changing Gender Constructions in the Modern Middle East  in the History Department. There s nothing wrong with those studies, unless they crowd out learning how the progressive policies of Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have failed in France, for instance, leading to a stagnant economy with few opportunities for progress. Or how capitalism has delivered billions from poverty, including in Communist China, where the growth miracle of recent decades was facilitated by policies that encouraged entrepreneurship and private enterprise.Hillary Clinton missed some history lessons too, apparently. She alluded to Nixon s presidency which  would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.  That isn t true, of course; Nixon resigned from office. It was her husband Bill who was impeached. Amazing she would get that wrong, in delivering what was sure to be a much-reviewed address. Maybe a little too much of that Chardonnay, Mrs. Clinton?

Who wasn t proud to see our beautiful and smart First Lady in appropriate and stylish outfits every day. She won us over in a big way and made the designers who refused to dress her look like schmucks. She needs no one to hold her hand to put together a wardrobe If anything, First Lady Melania Trump proved to the naysayers that you can be beautiful AND smart Well done!Richard Johnson of the New York Post: Melania Trump is proving to the fashion designers who said they wouldn t help her that dressing well is the best revenge.The first lady s trip to Saudi Arabia, the Vatican, Belgium and Sicily   wearing mostly Dolce & Gabbana   was a fashion tour de force that has forced many naysayers in the rag trade to rethink.The list of designers who said they wouldn t dress Melania is long, led by Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Christian Siriano and Sophie Theallet.But Melania has managed to look smashing in dozens of different ensembles, from her white Ralph Lauren jumpsuit on election night to the D&G 3-D floral coat she wore in Sicily on Friday.Defending the former model against critics who harped on the garment s $51,500 cost, the Washington Post s Robin Givhan opined,  Frankly, the floral coat is beautiful. Givhan gets that Melania Trump is one smart woman who coordinated her fashion according to the place she was visiting:Givhan reported:  Clothes can be deeply symbolic. And Trump s choice of Dolce & Gabbana   an Italian brand that has been deeply inspired by Sicilian culture   for a trip to Sicily makes sense. Gabbana also has been quite vocal and enthusiastic in his willingness to associate his brand with the first lady There is a softening, a melting,  stylist Phillip Bloch told me.  Fashion people are fickle and fake. They are starting to see she is a beautiful woman who is married to the president, and it is an honor to dress her. Deliveries to Trump Tower have picked up.  Most days, the lobby is brimming with wardrobe boxes delivered for Melania,  a source told me.  Once she tries on the outfits and decides what she will keep, the boxes come back downstairs. Not since Jacqueline Kennedy has there been a first lady who needs less help. She doesn t need couture. She can buy off the rack, and it looks beautiful,  Bloch said.  She knows her size, and she knows what works on her. She luxuriates in minimal. Read more NYP",politics,2017/5/30,0

It was almost as though the people around Hillary were well practiced in how to toss her into the vehicle before the cameras could catch her having a seizure only months before the election.Watch: Infowars   Hillary was seen wearing the blue sunglasses during the 9/11 memorial in New York City where she later collapsed from complications stemming from her numerous health issues.Given her lack of fashion concerns   she s regularly seen wearing pantsuits everywhere she goes   it s unlikely her blue sunglasses were meant as a fashion statement.Epileptic patients often wear Zeiss Z1 blue lenses in particular because they are effective at treating photosensitive epilepsy. The Z1 lens is highly effective in controlling photoparoxysmal response in a very large number of photosensitive epilepsy patients irrespective of their epilepsy or antiepileptic drug treatment,  according to a 2006 studypublished in Epilepsia.  The lens might become a valid resource in the daily activity of any clinician who cares for patients with epilepsy.

0562,POLICE REFUSED To Believe German Manâ€™s Emergency Call Saying Girlfriend Was Being Raped By Refugee With Machete While Camping,"The ban, which also applies to women and children and elderly relatives from war torn countries, has been put in place for two years after the country revealed the crisis will cost  37bn in 2017.Now just days after the Bundestag voted to speed up deportation and mandatory finger printing, it s emerged they have outlined the country needs 300,000 people a YEAR for the next 40 years to stop population decline.  Express UKA major shake up is underway in Germany after police refused to take seriously a 999 call from a young man who called in to say his girlfriend was being raped yards from him.The officer who took the call did not believe the desperate man on the other end of the line, and said:  You are not messing with me I hope? The terrified boyfriend had been threatened with a machete when the Ghanaian refugee entered the tent he shared with his girlfriend at a campsite near Bonn and told to remain where he was.But the boyfriend had a hard time getting police to take him seriously. Hmm,  was the first reaction from the female police officer on the line.  Where exactly is this rape happening?  she added.The man was forced to watch as the attacker violated his 23-year-old partner   and the police never arrived.The 26-year-old boyfriend eventually scooped her up and began walking with her along a main road looking for help.He called police a second time   and again they did not take their account of what happened at face value.Finally, nearly 30 minutes later, officers arrived and the victim was taken to hospital.Frank Piontek, spokesman for the Bonn Police, conceded that the  incoming official in the control centre, after our findings, did not initially correctly categorize the circumstances of the first call and reacted inappropriately in her language. The second call was also not handled properly, he added, saying a major review of procedures is underway following the attack in April.A photofit picture of the attacker led to his arrest and DNA testing confirmed his guilt.A CD player he stole from the tent was found at his refugee centre.He tried to flee when police moved in to arrest him, flinging a rucksack at one officer.It turned out that the backpack was stolen from a barbecue party shortly before the rape occurred.

A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian, Francis told reporters Wednesday aboard the papal plane. This is not in the Gospel. The pope s comments were first made public on Thursday. They obviously got to the pope,  Trump said.  He doesn t know me   the Pope heard only one side of the story. In response to Pope Francis  comments, candidate Trump told his supporters that I am a Christian and I am proud of it,  and also attacked the Mexican government for  using the pope as a pawn. There can t be a good economy without good businessmen, without their capacity to create and to produce,  he said, shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.The Pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful. Moreover, only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat, he suggested. The world of work is a human priority,  Francis said,  and it s also a priority for the pope. There s always been a friendship between the church and work, starting with Jesus, who was a worker. When work is weakened, it s democracy that enters into crisis,  he said.  There s a social compact. Without denouncing unemployment benefits, Francis insisted that state intervention wasn t a real solution.  A monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn t solve the problem. It has to be resolved with work for everyone,  he said.",politics,2017/5/28,0

0573,"PLOT THICKENS: D.C. POLICE CHIEF Who Oversaw Seth Rich Murder Socialized With Top Democrats, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz","More and more evidence is revealed every day, that points to the real possibility that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the person who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and that there is an all-out effort to cover it up, or completely dismiss it as a  tin-foil hat  theory by social media platforms, the leftist media and the Democrat Party. Twitter just suspended the WND account for posting a story that suggested disgraced DNC chief and top Democratic strategist Donna Brazile may have interceded in the Seth Rich murder investigation. In the WND exclusive story titled:Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell. And now, Big League Politics is reporting associations the DC police chief who resigned only a month after Seth Rich was murdered ran in the same circles as many close to Hillary and top DNC officials. The police chief who oversaw Seth Rich s unsolved murder case has socialized and been honored alongside key Hillary Clinton advisers and even Rich s own boss at the Democratic National Committee. Rich is widely reported to be the source of Wikileaks  damning 2016 email release that showed the DNC colluding to hand the nomination to Clinton at the expense of Bernie Sanders. He was gunned down in D.C. 12 days before Wikileaks  release.On Sunday, July 10, 2016, at approximately 4:19 am, members of the Fifth District DC MPD were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots.  Upon arrival on the scene, members located an adult male victim conscious and breathing, and suffering from gunshot wounds.  The victim was transported to an area hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead.The decedent was identified as 27-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, of Northwest, DC.Controversy continues to swirl around the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, that detectives working for the MPD under Chief Lanier called a  botched robbery  (even though nothing of any value appeared to have been stolen from Rich s body) after he was shot several times only blocks from his home.Former Metropolitan Police Department chief Cathy Lanier resigned from her post the month after Rich s murder to accept a position running security for the National Football League. She sits on the Washington Police Foundation board alongside Heather Podesta, the D.C. power broker who was married to Clinton campaign chief John Podesta s lobbyist brother Tony.In 2014, Lanier was honored on ELLE magazine s list of the ten most powerful women in Washington alongside top Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and longtime Clinton friend and informal adviser Neera Tanden.

He warns against immigration and political correctness as two things that will lead us to doom.

Slow down our immigration from these countries    Dr. James MitchellWE VE REPORTED ON THE TRUTH OF WHAT IMMIGRATION IS DOING   IT S A PLAN   IT S A CALIPHATE!Last September, a shocking video was released showing a Muslim Imam speaking before a group. He told the group to breed with Europeans. Yes, the plan is to breed with Europeans until all of Europe is Muslim. THE VIDEO IS BELOW:So now we have a second video from Denmark where an Imam is telling how Muslims are conquering Europe and that Muslims won t integrate into European society. We ve translated the video in the text below.These two videos follow with what we know. The invasion of Europe has a purpose and it s a very dark purpose. Conquering Europe is the end game Is America next?On hidden camera an imam explains how Muslims are  conquering  Europe and that Muslims should not integrate into society.Danish TV2 right now has a program called  Mosques behind the veil  which is focusing on whether a number of mosques discourage or contribute to integration.  Right now we are in a time when we are opening these countries, says Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, the head imam of the mosque of the Islamic Union in Denmark, in secret recordings from the third episode of  Mosques behind the veil .The Imam speaks to TV2 s mole  Fatima , who is seeking guidance about how she as a newly immigrated Muslim should act in Denmark, and Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi explains that Muslims are now consuming Denmark and Europe.The link to the video is here but it is not translated: NYHEDER VIDEOAccording to experts TV2 has spoken with, the word open in an Islamist meaning is understood as  conquering .  Actually, opening sounds  beautiful , but this is the classic term for conquering a country, explains Professor Tina Magaard, who has studied the Quran and made fieldwork in Muslim communities in Denmark.According to Tina Magaard, some Islamic movements have the will to conquer Europe and the belief that one can.It is backed by a professor at the University of Copenhagen, Thomas Hoffmann, who has studied Islam and Islamic movements.  What al-Barazi says here, means conquest, but need not necessarily be understood as war-like conquest, he said.On hidden camera, Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, elaborates what he thinks about Muslims  entry into Denmark and Europe.  Now there are Muslim communities throughout Europe. This means that there are a large number of Muslims. A really large number.The Imam tells  Fatma  that since he came to Denmark, many more Muslims have come to Denmark, and it is important that Muslims are not  merged  with the rest of society.

Food stamp enrollment exploded during Obama s 8 years in office to be 44 million recipients.The American taxpayers are footing the bill for those who take advantage of the system. Here s the TRUTH about what the Trump administration has proposed for food stamps:WORK REQUIREMENTS: In reality, the president s proposed policy is based on two principles: requiring able-bodied adult recipients to work or prepare for work in exchange for benefits, and restoring minimal fiscal responsibility to state governments for the welfare programs they operate.The president s budget reasserts the basic concept that welfare should not be a one-way handout. Welfare should, instead, be based on reciprocal obligations between recipients and taxpayers.SHIFTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON STATES:Why should the federal government pay for almost all of the freebies?

We ve documented this trend across America of Islam creeping into the schools. The latest case in San Diego of Sharia Law being taught in the classrooms has ended up in court:FEDERAL LAWSUIT Filed Against San Diego School District s Pro-Islam, Pro-Sharia Law PolicyOne question should be asked with this infiltration of Muslim prayer in our schools: WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER RELIGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM DOING ANYTHING CLOSE TO PRAYING IN SCHOOL?  The largest school district in Saratoga County says it will allow Muslim students to pray in rooms in at its  high school.The Shenendehowa High School Principal says classrooms are being set aside so Muslim students can pray during Ramadan. Since then, we ve heard from parents who are against the move.One parent sent us a letter explaining her concerns saying:  Since prayer for other religions was removed from school years ago, I feel as Shen has crossed the line on allowing this on campus.  Some folks we talked to in Clifton Park agreed, like David Chapleau.  You just can t bring religion into a public institution where were really trying to teach kids to the idea of opening their critical faculties,  Chapleau said. The woman s outcry is in response to an email from the Shenendehowa High School Principal to students and parents. It addresses the month of Ramadan, a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims. It says, in part: Prayer occurs on a daily basis for practicing Muslims. This can be challenging in today s modern public high school. In an attempt to make reasonable accommodations for students and employees to meet their personal religious obligations, room 65 in High School West and room 109 in High School East have been set aside so students can incorporate this important aspect of their religion into their daily activities while at school.  The letter explains two classrooms will be set aside for students to meet their religious obligations during school hours. A school spokesperson says the decision was made after the high school principal met with the leader of a local mosque in an attempt to improve the school s cultural proficiency. She says the school can t refuse a student s request to leave class for required prayer, and says the space allows Muslim students to return to class quickly after praying.READ MORE: CBS6LOCAL",politics,2017/5/25,0

She said they were irrelevant, but they were somewhere.Kim Dotcom was saying he had  em or could get  em. Everybody was wondering where they were.

Hannity even asked Dotcom to appear on his show, hoping that he would reveal evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and NOT the Russians.Here was the first email from Kim Dotcom where he claims to have known Seth Rich and that Rich was the Wikileaks source.  Dotcom also claims he was involved in the email exchange.I knew Seth Rich. I know he was the @Wikileaks source. I was involved. https://t.co/MbGQteHhZM  Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 20, 2017Sean Hannity responded to Kim Dotcom s tweet:You are the evidence?

The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.After FOX News disavowed the Seth Rich story, liberal rag  The Daily Beast  published a story with unnamed sources at FOX News who were  embarrassed  by Sean Hannity pursuing this story, claiming he had  no evidence .Sean Hannity re-tweeted their baseless, nameless story here:Very interesting.

0625,D.C. BAR OWNER Where Seth Rich Was Last Seen Drops Bombshell: NO EMPLOYEES Of Bar Questioned By DC Policeâ€¦Never Asked For Surveillance Tapes [VIDEO],"Last week, Private Investigator Rod Wheeler appeared on Fox5 news in DC with an update in the unsolved murder of DNC IT expert Seth Rich, claiming proof exists on Rich s laptop proving he was Julian Assange s source for leaked DNC emails during the 2016 election   an account in direct conflict to the Russian hacking narrative based on a discredited IT firm s report.Wheeler walked back his statements the next day, however the fuse was already lit  Weaponized autists on Reddit and 4chan began furiously digging back into the Seth Rich case for clues in the still unsolved murder   and they went deep.Among the findings were Seth Rich s Reddit account, email addresses, and Twitter accounts   one of which was in support of candidate Bernie Sanders. As an aside  before joining the DNC, Rich moved to Washington DC to take a job with polling and research firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner  whose founder Stanley Greenberg was a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton.Reddit s the_donald goes darkAs Seth Rich posts reached a crescendo Friday night  dominating the front page of /r/The_Donald, the Conde Nast-linked website shut the  subreddit  down for around 12 hours following a moderator s unrelated declaration of war on the rest of Reddit over censorship  completely killing the Seth Rich momentum. When The_Donald was reopened, officially  to aid the Seth Rich effort   the offending moderator had been banned and two other mods were removed from their positions. Seth Rich posts, however, are notably sparse. Oh, and Reddit edited Seth Rich s account during the lockout.Meanwhile in New ZealandKim Dotcom is pissed   and has been plotting revenge against Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Hollywood after being targeted in the biggest copyright infringement case in history  which included a massive illegal (and then legal) raid on his New Zealand mansion by 76 armed officers and two helicopters.Dotcom tweets that Democrats attacked his family and stole his assets in a copyright infringement case and appears to be suggesting that he was paying them back by sending Rich s DNC emails to Wikileaks:Democrats destroyed my business, attacked my family, stole my assets in a pay4play strike for the @MPAACounterstrike:Trump Presidency   Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 19, 2017Sean Hannity has offered Dotcom a national platform (which Kim retweeted)I knew Seth Rich.

Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) May 22, 2017Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich all discussed the mysterious murder of DNC staffer last week, who, according to Rich s parents was getting ready to work for Hillary s campaign when he was murdered on his way home from a local bar late at night. Here is a compilation of Hannity and Limbaugh s remarks on the Rich case:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXn6FzWBS4oWhy were no employees of Joe s City Bar where Rich was last seen questioned about his final hours leading up to his murder? Why was the surveillance tape in the bar not seen by investigators? WND A manager of the Washington, D.C., bar where Democratic National Committee worker Seth Rich was last spotted hours before he was shot and killed last summer told WND that D.C. police officers never interviewed the bar s staff or requested any evidence from the bar, including the bar s surveillance video from that night, as part of an investigation into Rich s murder.The revelation backs up a claim made by a private investigator who worked on the case who said D.C. police were told to  stand down  on the investigation.WND also can report that the investigator recently was ordered to  cease and desist  his work on the murder case. The police never asked for the surveillance video from that night,  a manager of Lou s City Bar told WND.His name is being withheld for this story.He said the bar s surveillance video runs in a cycle of 30 days and that, by now, any footage that may have existed of Rich the last night he was seen alive has been taped over.Furthermore, the manager said police never asked for any other kind of evidence from the bar such as Rich s bar receipt from that night. The manager did note he wasn t sure if Rich paid using a credit card or cash. Seth Rich s girlfriend, best friend and parents all speak out about the brutal murder that DC detectives are calling a  botched robbery  that left Rich dead while leaving all of his valuables, including his wallet on his person. Seth Rich s parents admitted that after Seth was shot, police reported that he was  quite talkative . If Seth was  quite talkative,  then why aren t there any leads on his killers? Seth s parents appear to be Hillary sycophants. They appear to be very proud of their son as they tell Crime Watch Daily that he was just getting ready to go to work for Hillary s campaign. They also adamantly stand behind the Democrat Party and claim they are angered by any claim that a hit was ordered on Rich by online citizen journalists.As more and more evidence is being revealed about Rich s possible role as the leaker of the DNC emails to Wikileaks, the attitude of Seth s parents towards citizen journalists has taken a surprising turn. In this video that was just released, Rich s parents appear to be praising the work of citizen journalists that are forcing the investigation into Seth Rich s death via social media.https://twitter.com/RedPillDropper/status/866071104112209921According to research conducted by a 4Chan citizen journalists, Joseph Capone, the owner of Lou s City Bar where Rich was last seen alive, visited the East Wing of the White House 4 days before the murder of Seth Rich.A visit by a Joseph P. Capone to the East Wing of the White House on July is verified on the government White House visitor log website. We cannot verify that this is the same Joe Capone who owns Lou s City bar where Seth was last seen. According the White House Museum website, the East Wing is reserved for  the first lady and her staff, including the White House social secretary and correspondence staff.:Crime Watch Daily investigated the murder of Seth Rich and compiled an interesting video that includes interviews with Seth s girlfriend, best friend and parents.Although there are pockets of darkness, for the most part this neighborhood is pretty well-lit. Investigators tell Crime Watch Daily in the early morning hours of July 10, Seth was walking home. He was only about a block and a half away from home when he was gunned down, shot in the back. The officers who were there and they said  Yeah, he was quite talkative, he did not realize he had been shot,'  said Joel Rich, Seth s father.But an hour and a half later at a nearby hospital, Seth was pronounced dead.Heartbreaking news to Kelsey Mulka. She was just on the phone with him, and in a split-second he was gone. Now Mulka is breaking news in our exclusive interview, revealing details, telling Crime Watch Daily there was no sign of trouble in his voice that terrible morning. ",politics,2017/5/22,0
0626,THE PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONâ€¦Explained As If You Were 5-Years-Old," Among the findings:A Complex Fiscal Picture Welfare use. Our findings show that many of the preconceived notions about the fiscal impact of illegal households turn out to be inaccurate. In terms of welfare use, receipt of cash assistance programs tends to be very low, while Medicaid use, though significant, is still less than for other households. Only use of food assistance programs is significantly higher than that of the rest of the population. Also, contrary to the perceptions that illegal aliens don t pay payroll taxes, we estimate that more than half of illegals work  on the books.  On average, illegal households pay more than $4,200 a year in all forms of federal taxes. Unfortunately, they impose costs of $6,950 per household.The Impact of Amnesty. Finally, our estimates show that amnesty would significantly increase tax revenue. Because both their income and tax compliance would rise, we estimate that under the most likely scenario the average illegal alien household would pay 77 percent ($3,200) more a year in federal taxes once legalized. While not enough to offset the 118 percent ($8,200) per household increase in costs that would come with legalization, amnesty would significantly increase both the average income and tax payments of illegal aliens.What s Different About Today s Immigration. Many native-born Americans observe that their ancestors came to America and did not place great demands on government services. Perhaps this is true, but the size and scope of government were dramatically smaller during the last great wave of immigration. Not just means-tested programs, but expenditures on everything from public schools to roads were only a fraction of what they are today. Thus, the arrival of unskilled immigrants in the past did not have the negative fiscal implications that it does today. Moreover, the American economy has changed profoundly since the last great wave of immigration, with education now the key determinant of economic success. The costs that unskilled immigrants impose simply reflect the nature of the modern American economy and welfare state. It is doubtful that the fiscal costs can be avoided if our immigration policies remain unchanged. Center For Immigration Study",politics,2017/5/22,0

0628,BREAKING NEWS: Reince Priebus Makes Early Return Home From Trumpâ€™s First Foreign Trip,"The White House confirmed to FOX Business that Priebus would be heading back to Washington D.C. after the stop in Saudi Arabia, part of the president s visit to the Middle East, and insisted this was always part of the administration s plan.Natalie Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House, told FOX Business,  It has always been planned for Reince to return to Washington following the Saudi Arabia portion of the trip. It s a big week in D.C. for the president s agenda with our budget release coming soon and discussions continuing on tax reform, so he s needed back at home for that. When asked which other officials would be coming home, Strom said,  Only a few senior administration officials are staying on for the whole trip, which is typical for these kinds of trips. They re attending the stops that most pertain to their responsibilities. Off the top of my head I know that Secretary [of State] Tillerson and General McMaster won t be on for the entirety. As FOX Business reported Friday, Priebus s position in the White House is once again in jeopardy as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney are a few of the candidates under consideration to replace him if the president decides to go that route, according to sources close to the situation.On Friday, the White House did not deny the possibility that Priebus could be replaced.While the administration may believe it s typical for some officials to stay and others to head home, according to experts outside the White House, it s unusual for a chief of staff to head home early on such an important trip.

0630,"BRAVO! PRESIDENT TRUMP Renews Americaâ€™s Standing As World Leader With Historical, No Apologies Speech To Arab Nations [VIDEO]"," Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely  invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death.    President Donald J. TrumpDonald Trump insisted in a speech addressing global  Islamic extremism  that Muslim leaders must scare would-be terrorists into submission, warning them about the impact suicide bombings will have on their immortal souls. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory   piety to evil will bring you no dignity,  Trump said in a sumptuous Saudi ballroom that put Mar-a-Lago to shame. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  he said. Heroes don t kill innocents,  a confident Trump declared at the King Abdulaziz Conference Center in Riyadh.  They save them. The president urged 55 world leaders from Arab and other Muslim nations to  drive out  terrorists from every corner of their lives   including mosques   in a zero-tolerance approach that lines up with his 2016 campaign rhetoric. Drive them out!  he said.  Drive them out of your places of worship, Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy lands, and drive them out of this earth,  he trumpeted.Trump s performance was forceful at times but largely a cautious, measured and presidential-sounding effort, raising his voice only once. With God s help this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed,  the president said.Trump insisted that fighting terrorism is  a battle between good and evil,  not between  different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death,  Trump declared.  If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen and what will be the end result. He predicted that in the absence of multi-nation commitments to action,  peaceful societies will be engulfed by violence, and the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. And if the world doesn t unite to fight ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas and other groups, he said,  not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, we will be judged by God. Trump said Middle Eastern nations  can t wait  for the U.S. to solve the terror problem for them. Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization,  he said.Trump took pains to isolate Iran in his speech, saying the Islamic republican is spreading  destruction and chaos  throughout the Middle East and gives terrorists  safe harbor, financial backing and the social standing needed for recruitment. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, too, declared on Sunday that  the Iranian regime has been the spearhead of global terrorism. Trump called defeating global terrorism  history s great test,  as he urged summit attendees to  vanquish the forces that terrorism brings with it every single time. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent from hatred,  Trump said. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it,  Trump said, reading from teleprompters.Watch video here:King Salman seemed to agree with Trump s most aggressive and foreboding statement   that jihadi terrorists place their souls at risk. Our way to achieve the goals of our religion and win everlasting life in heaven is to promote the tolerant values of Islam, which are based in peace and moderation,  he said in introducing Trump from behind a desk onstage. There is no honor in committing murder,  he said through a translator.  Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance.   it considers killing an innocent soul tantamount to killing all of humanity. Salman called on Gulf Cooperation Council leaders to  reject extremism, work on fighting all forms of terrorism, stop its financing and its propagation, dry up its sources, and stand firm in confronting this scourge that poses a danger to all of humanity. And he pledged to prosecute terrorists and terror financing, to  eradicate  the ISIS terror army  and other terrorist organizations regardless of their religious, sect or ideology.

Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017Conservative comedian Mark Dice also reminded him that his comments on a recent Jimmy Kimmel show about how it was tough to be a conservative in Hollywood, was likely the final straw that caused ABC to cancel his show: You calling out the Liberals for their insanity on Jimmy Kimmel was the last straw for the Network, but someone had to do it. Thanks, Tim!  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017A petition was started last week by  Last Man Standing  fans and now has over 371K signatures. The petition asks ABC to reconsider their decision to cancel the  Last Man Standing  and to renew the show. Here is the LINK to that petition:The petition to ABC reads:Despite consistently high rankings, especially considering the time slot in which it is aired, Tim Allen s show  Last Man Standing  has been cancelled by the network on which it is aired, ABC. Last Man Standing stands out in the sea of network television sitcoms.  It is a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values. Last Man Standing was not just selling conservative ideals though, as some of the characters in the show are clearly of the liberal persuasion, yet the characters on the show all manage to get along and take care of one another, despite their politically opposed views.  The show is about more than politics though, it is about family.  In fact, politics is only a secondary part of the show, but one in which many Americans can readily identify. Last Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers.  And sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been cancelled.The intent of this petition/boycott is to attempt to get ABC to renew the show.  With that in mind, I will no longer be watching any ABC shows.  I have cancelled the DVR settings for the other ABC shows that I regularly watch.  If you want to help try to save Last Man Standing, I encourage you to do the same.  Even if you are not willing to boycott the network, but still want to save the show, please sign this petition and share it.  If you do plan to boycott ABC, please say so when you sign.  Let them hear our voices.Now, Studio 20th Century Fox Television is looking for a new home for canceled Tim Allen comedy  Last Man Standing. Speaking to Variety Thursday, studio presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman said that they were surprised by ABC s decision to pull the plug on the show. That s the one that s really an open sore right now,  Davis said. Kurtzman added,  We really were expecting a pickup. The fact that we didn t get a pickup was a surprise and a disappointment. I think no one was more disappointed than Tim Allen, such a huge star with such a huge following. But the series, which was ABC s second most-watched comedy last season behind  Modern Family,  may not be dead. Asked whether  Last Man Standing  would be shopped to other networks, Kurtzman said,  We re starting to explore that. If it s not going to go forward at ABC, of course Jonnie and I are hopeful that we can find another home for it. Political and social conservatives have been vocal in their disappointment over the show s end. Allen, its star and executive producer, is conservative and a supporter of President Trump.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey denied that  Last Man Standing  was canceled because of Allen s right-leaning politics, and said that it was, instead, a scheduling decision.  Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of that s where we landed,  she said.

Our media and politicians are doing everything they can to destroy Trump How negative was press coverage of President Trump s first 100 days in office? Far more than that of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, according to a new report from the Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The Harvard scholars analyzed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the main newscasts (not talk shows) of CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC during Trump s initial time in office. They found, to no one s surprise, that Trump absolutely dominated news coverage in the first 100 days. And then they found that news coverage was solidly negative   80 percent negative among those outlets studied, versus 20 percent positive.The numbers for previous presidents: Barack Obama, 41 percent negative, 59 percent positive; George W. Bush, 57 percent negative, 43 percent positive; and Bill Clinton, 60 percent negative, 40 percent positive.Accusations of bias aside, it s simply a fact that a number of negative things happened in Trump s opening 100 days. The Russia investigation, for example, was a source of endless criticism from Democrats and other Trump opponents. The travel ban executive order led to intense argument and losses for the administration in the courts. The healthcare debacle created more negative coverage because it was a major screwup and a setback for both Trump and House Republicans.That said, the coverage of some news organizations was so negative, according to the Harvard study, that it seems hard to argue that the coverage was anywhere near a neutral presentation of facts. Assessing the tone of news coverage, the Harvard researchers found that CNN s Trump coverage was 93 percent negative, and seven percent positive. The researchers found the same numbers for NBC.Obama and Hillary s hero had this to say about taking down an enemy:Obama Campaign Manager and Senior Adviser had this to say about Trump last June: IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY BEAT TRUMP. HE MUST BE DESTROYED THOROUGHLY. HIS KIND MUST NOT RISE AGAIN. Read more: WE",politics,2017/5/20,0
0638,LOL! DEMOCRATSâ€?â€œPoster Child For Stupidityâ€?Canâ€™t Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump.Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators  connect the dots,  then his campaign s alleged collusion with Russia will become apparent.Given Waters  public profile as a staunch Trump opponent, MSNBC host Katy Tur asked the lawmaker what Democrats actually stand for beyond opposing Trump s agenda. Congresswoman, what do the Democrats stand for other than being against Donald Trump?  Tur asked.  What do you stand for other than trying to get Donald Trump impeached? Everyone knows that I am the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and that I have spent many, many hours and days implementing the Dodd-Frank reforms,  Waters responded.The California Democrat proceeded to frame her work on Dodd-Frank in the context of opposing Republicans, which Tur noted. We pushed back on the Republicans, we fight against them,  Waters said.  [They] attempt[ed] to go get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before we came up with the reforms under Dodd-Frank. Tur pushed back. Are Democrats focusing enough on their ideas?  she asked.Waters then went on to explain how effective the Democrat Party has been in their organizing efforts to disrupt town halls where Republican political leaders are speaking to their constituents. Listen, if you have not been keeping up with the town halls that have been going on,  Waters said, referring to the protesters at many Republican town halls, where we have basically organized America around the [Affordable Care Act] and protected Obamacare and the thousands of people who have come out who now are very much informed about the difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare.   WFBWhat Maxine doesn t understand is that when Tea Party members attended town hall meetings across American and challenged their elected leaders on reckless tax legislation they didn t need to be organized by the Republican Party. Tea Party members weren t just targeting Democrat politicians, they were targeting anyone who they felt wasn t representing the people who elected them into office. ",politics,2017/5/20,0
0639,PRESIDENT TRUMP Lands in Saudi Arabia to Rare Red Carpet Treatment,"President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia to rare red carpet treatment. What a great way to begin the  President s first foreign trip that will last 9 days.Several symbolic gestures by the Saudis show a sign of respect and friendship. This is very different from when Obama went to Saudi Arabia last year and the kind didn t even come to the airport to greet him. He touched down in the Middle East this morning, hours after tweeting about his excitement for his first  big foreign trip.  Trump flew to the capital Riyadh overnight on Air Force One   becoming the only president to make Saudi Arabia, or any majority Muslim country, his first stop overseas as president. His arrival following a 6,700-mile flight was met with the pomp usually reserved for the likes of a Papal welcome in South America. The president got the red carpet treatment   literally   and some airport workers took off their shoes before manicuring it with brooms in 97-degree heat.Another symbolic gesture by the kingdom: There were 30 U.S. flags at the ready, a tiny fraction of the thousands that line streets and highways between the airport and the city center.The king greeted President Trump at the bottom of the stairs   a very rare scene.A 90-person Royal Saudi Air Forces honor guard practiced rifle drills and then stood at attention while Trump and his kingly escort ambled toward the terminal.Melania and Ivanka Trump seemed determine to make a statement by deplaning without head coverings.This was a  rare sight among women in Riyadh whose main choices are the hijab and the niqab. The King shook First Lady Melania Trump s hand   a rare scene.Still, the first lady stayed a half-dozen steps behind King Salman and her politician-husband, escorted by a lone U.S. Marine in full dress uniform. After a welcome ceremony inside the Royal Terminal, Trump and Salman sat together in  The Beast,  the White House s armored SUV that travels in the belly of Air Force One. The first stop was the glitzy Ritz-Carlton, whose exterior is being lit up at night with giant projected images of the American flag. Trump s first overseas speech is expected to frame the global fight against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups as a  battle between good and evil    but early drafts suggest he will not use the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism.  He will also call on leaders in the Middle East to  drive out terrorists from your places of worship.  Signs of American caution are everywhere as the president who once campaigned on the strength of excluding Muslims from the U.S. ventured into the nation whose king partners in construction with the Bin Laden Group. U.S. military snipers stood guard on nearby jetways. A duplicate Air Force One 747 jet stood by, lest Trump s schedule should be waylaid by engine trouble.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,2017/5/20,0
0640,OUTRAGE! Student Threatens Violence Against Trump In High School Yearbook Quote,"The double standard here is unbelievable! We just reported on a high school student in big trouble for saying  Build the Wall  in her yearbook quote. That s pretty harmless but the school took back the yearbooks .Fast forward and a high school student wrote out their thoughts on President Trump in the yearbook I would like to behead him. I do not like him. See the huge difference here?MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO)   Just under a month after a Big Lake trap team s photo was banned from the high school yearbook, another high school yearbook photo is making news.For its 2017 yearbook, Brainerd High School dedicated a page to President Donald Trump. Editors asked students their thoughts on the president, and shared the quotes next to their picture.One sophomore said,  I would like to behead him. I do not like him. The photo went viral, sparking controversy on Twitter. Now, that student is telling her side of the story. I was so confused, because at first, I didn t ever remember saying that,  15-year-old Camryn said.Camryn   who asked WCCO not to reveal her last name   says she had no idea a conversation with a classmate last September would lead to nationwide attention. She says the classmate never said she was working for the yearbook when she asked about then-candidate Donald Trump. I did not say,  I want to behead him.  I did not say,  I am going to behead him.  I just said,  Well I m sure we all wouldn t mind him being beheaded,    something along those lines,  Camryn said.  But there was never the direct quote,  I do not like him. I would like to behead him. That conversation exploded on social media 8 months later, with the help of at least one celebrity. Former  Joanie Loves Chachi  actor Scott Baio shared the photo, tagging the president, the FBI, Sean Hannity and Kellyanne Conway.Read more: CBS",politics,2017/5/20,0

0642,"IS SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM PLANNING To Make Hero Out Of Third Rate QB, Race Agitator Colin Kaepernick?","Martin Luther King Jr. would not likely be pleased to see such a divisive figure using his position as a professional athlete to promote a violent and threatening movement funded and promoted by politicians to divide our nation Colin Kaepernick s football career remains very much a question mark, but he s already left an impression on American culture, as his jersey and other gear from his protests in 2016 are now in the hands of the Smithsonian.The Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History and Culture continuously collects items of historic significance from African Americans involved in all phases of American life, and the sociologist and author Harry Edwards encouraged the museum to take a close look at Kaepernick. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback drew nationwide attention last year when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality in America.In September, 2016, the union for police officers who work San Francisco home games threatened a boycott of policing the stadium after the 49ers refused to discipline Colin Kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem and for his statements about law enforcement. If the 49ers organization fails to take action to stop this type of inappropriate behavior it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities, the letter reads.  The board of directors of the Santa Clara Police Officer s Association has a duty to protect its members and work to make all of their working environments free of harassing behavior. It also criticized what it called anti-police statements made by Kaepernick, calling them  insulting, inaccurate and completely unsupported by any facts. Edwards arranged for the donation of a jersey and other equipment to the Smithsonian, but did so with a request.  I said,  Don t wait 50 years to try to get some memorabilia and so forth on Kaepernick,  Edwards said, according to USA Today.  Let me give you a game jersey, some shoes, a picture.   And it should be put right there alongside Muhammad Ali. He s this generation s Ali. Daily Wire   Adopted by white parents in Wisconsin, Kaepernick is the biological child of a white woman and a black man. He was born in 1987.Kaepernick explained his refusal to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner, expressing solidarity with the net-marxist racial narratives of Black Lives Matter: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick describes himself as a black man in a society that  oppresses black people. Kaepernick s refusal to stand for our national anthem was considered anything but brave by many of his fans. Here s a picture of a fan burning Colin s jersey, a trend that was started shortly after Kaepernick used his position to promote the violent Black Lives Matter movement on the field as the other players honored our nation:Kaepernick remains unsigned even as players like Ryan Fitzpatrick sign deals, and there is, of course, the question of how much his very public and very controversial political stances may be harming his marketability.

0649,CROOKED HILLARY CLINTONâ€™S Latest Speech To Be Crashed By Angry HAITIANS Pushing For Answers,"Hillary Clinton always goes back to the black community and this is just another case of pandering. It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer",politics,2017/5/19,0
0650,GERMANY KICKING RESIDENTS OUT To Make Way For Refugees: Nurse Shocked After Being Kicked Out Of Same Flat For 16 Years,"Stories of governments removing citizens from their homes and apartments in European nations and replacing them with migrants in need of government subsidized housing is becoming more and more common. The Obama regime set the ball in motion for  fair share housing  or social engineering. Will our legislators be able to stop the insanity of displacing citizens who are receiving housing subsidies from our government in favor of refugees or illegal aliens? Having lived in the same flat for 16 years, a German woman is being forced to move out to make way for refugees, because building a new shelter is too expensive. The 51 year-old nurse, who has helped asylum seekers in the past, was shocked by the news.Bettina Halbey, who lives alone in the small town of Nieheim, received a letter from her landlord and the local municipality at the start of September, Die Welt newspaper reported on Thursday. I was completely shocked and I can t even begin to find the words to describe how the city has treated me,  Halbey told the German publication.  I have had to go through a lot of difficulties recently, and then I get this notice. It was like a kick in the teeth. Halbey will have until May 2016 to find a new place to live, along with her dog and her cat. The three-story building, where she rented a 90 sq/m flat will now be turned into accommodation for refugees, who are seeking to make Germany their new home.The mayor of Nieheim, Rainer Vidal, which has a population of just over 6,000, defended the decision to send the nurse packing, saying converting the building would be  the cheapest option. A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost  30,000 ($33,600). This solution will cost me nothing,  he told Die Welt.Over half the population of Germany lives in rented accommodation and the country has laws to defend the rights of tenants. Normally, only a private individual can terminate the terms of a contract for personal use. A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable,  Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants  Federation, told the Telegraph.

The proposal will now be open to public comment for 90 days.Politico mentioned Protect Our Internet as one of the groups that organized the FCC protest, but failed to mention the group s ties to members of DisruptJ20 and antifa, which have been involved in violent protests against the presidential inauguration and conservative speakers on college campuses.Read more: Washington Free Beacon",politics,2017/5/18,0

Unless we all find a way to stand together and stop Barack Obama and the Democrat party s fundamental transformation from happening we ll be looking for another country who cares more about its citizens than its immigrant population This is the last post on this blog. I am leaving Sweden for good shortly, and will no longer be following its descent from what was once the third most prosperous country in the world. Frankly, it s just too damn depressing.I was born and raised in Sweden, which leaves a cultural mark even though I moved to USA in the 1990s and have spent the better part of my adult life as an American. Coming back for a few years has been a shocking experience.When I was a child, Sweden was a dull yet very safe place to live. Yes, there was a heavy blanket of socialism and collectivist values covering everything, but there was a core of pragmatism beneath the redness. The intention and goal was always to benefit the citizens, even though they went about things in a backwards manner.Prime minister L fven Today, it s as if the inmates are running the asylum. The politicians are participating in a chicken race of  goodness  where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retirees, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thorougly ignored. Violence is exploding. Jihadist Trojan horses are flowing through the porous border along with the tens of thousands ID-less refugees.But what makes me the most pessimistic about Sweden s future is how the social fabric itself has been undermined.Now, to be clear, it is my opinion that modest immigration is healthy for society and beneficial for trade, cultural development and so forth. Protectionism as a concept is counter-productive, while free trade and the ability for skilled labor to go where they re in demand is beneficial for everyone.Having said that, what Sweden is doing is something completely different. The once homogenous population has been forever altered by a rapid and massive addition of people from vastly different cultures and value-systems. 26,8% of the population is now foreign-born or with at least one foreign-born parent, and the national census bureau estimates that some 150 000 per year will arrive to the country of just 9,8 million residents.There simply is no possible way to absorb and assimilate such volumes of people, period. Then you are merely creating ethnic enclaves, which due to incompatible language, culture and job skills become ghettos, which in turns brews crime, misery and extremism. Once the inflow has exceeded the capacity for absorbtion, further immigration only makes the problem worse.It s like someone having read that a cup of green tea per day is healthy, so they make it a policy to chug four gallons per day, every day. It s a good thing overdone to the extreme until it becomes toxic.Then you have the Swedish school system. There really is no nice way to put it; it s a complete disaster. The minister of education is a man-boy who spends his time making Youtube-videos showing heart-signs with his hands to boost school results, while university-level students can t read and comprehend the course literature.Education minister Gustav FridolinSince there is a delay in the changes in the school system, it is only in recent years the full impact of the knowledge-averse  progressive  school system is starting to be felt. Hard facts are largely irrelevant; the important thing is to sit in a group and discuss things until a consensus is reached. But with no hard facts to base the conclusions on, it becomes an exercise in futility because it s all random assumptions and opinions. As a university-level history student (!) was quoted as saying in newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the other day:  Why would all these dates matter? Who cares in what order things happened? That s not exactly fertile soil for creating the researchers and engineers of the future.Financially, Sweden is an oddity in that it never had its real estate correction when Lehman Bros went belly-up and the housing market everywhere in the West crashed. Sweden just kept steaming ahead, which means housing is ridiculously overinflated. In Stockholm, the real estate prices increased 19% and in Gothenburg 24% in the last 12 months alone   from an already sky-high level.Tear-down abandoned house from 1932 with small, unremarkable lot in the outskirts of Stockholm. Current bid: 7,5 million SEK, or close to $900,000.As a result, personal debt of the Swedish population is at an all-time high. To keep all this afloat the normal mortgage interest rates are at 2% with central bank Riksbanken at -0,25%, and yet a significant portion of the borrowers are hanging by a thread. If and when foreign banks and investors decide it s time to turn their backs on Sweden (as happened in the early 1990s) there s going to be a lot of pain.Then you have the financial obligations going forward. Like much of the western world, there is a demographic change where fewer tax-paying adults are to support a glut of retirees. What makes it especially dire for Sweden is that in addition to the old Swedes, there s also a ton of elderly immigrants that are granted  family visas  based on younger relatives having been granted asylum. They ve never paid a dime in taxes, yet enter the system with full benefits from day one. In theory, this would be made up for by the younger relatives working and paying taxes. Sadly, this is not the case; while ethnical Swedes have a 82% employment rate, immigrants only have 57% with non-Europeans coming in at just 51%.If Sweden was a person, it d be like the guy with three mortgages, seven maxed-out credit cards and four collection agencies chasing him that just signed a lease for a brand new BMW X6. Simply put, there s a lot of red ink in the future; it just hasn t been fully realized yet.Finally, there s the sorry state of the Swedish defense. After decades of constant slashing of the defense budget, the extent of Swedish ambition is to stall an invader for a week in a limited area. This with war raging in Europe, Russian missiles pointed at Sweden in Kaliningrad, and Russian submarines and bomber jets openly thumbing their nose at Sweden as they intrude on Swedish territory on a regular basis. The power vacuum in Scandinavia is so tangible you can almost hear a sucking sound as you fly over it. This, too, will require massive investments when the penny finally drops amongst Swedish politicians.So while I can t claim to be any kind of authority on macroeconomics or social predictive models, I see red lights across the board.In some ways, I d compare the country to a farm. Previously, Sweden acted like a sensible farmer and planted wheat here, carrots there, potatoes over there et cetera, by implementing free schooling, sound infrastructure investments, state-financed research and so forth. A few decades later, they reaped the rewards and climbed the prosperity ladder.In the late 1960s, this pragmatic line was abandoned as leftist idealist Olof Palme took over. But there was plenty to harvest from previous years, so Sweden continued to be the land of milk and honey for a good long while. Then things started drying up, and the process has been one of gradual erosion and decline since the 1990s.The famous Swedish health care system is a good example. 120 000 hospital beds in the late 1960s became 20 000 today. Cancer patients are put on waiting lists for months. Entire emergency wards shut down for summer. The crumbling Swedish railroad system is another symptom I examined in-depth last year. The aforementioned defense that now consist of about three fat generals and a rusty rifle (bullets withheld for budgetary reasons).A sensible farmer would see the problems for what they are and hurry to plant new seeds, so as to return to bountiful harvests of wheat, carrots, potatoes etc. Instead, the Swedish politicians goes by dogma and plants what they think SHOULD grow. So they plant M & Ms, hot dogs and pretzels. The results won t be fully evident for a few years yet, but as the last reserves of the old harvests are depleted, things will get  Interesting.From what I can see, there simply is no plausible scenario where these social tensions and future financial committments will not lead to a downward spiral of hardship and strife. I hope I m wrong. I really do, because I have friends and family I care about that will remain here to see it all play out.But I won t. I ll be back in the US being mad at Obama for being a lying scumbag. And if Trump manages to get elected in 2016? Whoo boy. A racist ignoramus who takes pride in the worst qualities of a cranky eight-year old should make George  Dumbo  Bush seem like Abe Lincoln by comparison. So every country has its problems. USA has its corrupt yokel in office, just as Sweden has Stefan L fven. Via: The Sweden Report ",politics,2017/5/18,0

0661,LEGAL EXPERT JONATHAN TURLEY Shoots Down Joe Scarboroughâ€™s Case Against Trump: â€œNot obstructionâ€?[Video],"Legal Expert Jonathan Turley listened as Joe Scarborough laid out a lengthy timeline to make a case of obstruction on President Trump. His response is awesome and very precise in its reasons for not recommending obstruction charges. Turley is a Democrat but is a very fair legal expert who rules according to the law how refreshing! While the left freaks out about nothing, the people like Turley who are REALLY qualified to judge this are saying it s a nothingburger. We don t even have evidence of wrongdoing but talk of impeachment is all over the place.Please sit back, relax and listen to the voice of reason Professor Jonathan Turley: There was  ample reason  to fire Sally Yates when, as acting Attorney General, she instructed the Department of Justice not to enforce President Trump s executive order on immigration.  Obstruction of justice requires that you act to obstruct or interfere usually with a judicial or congressional proceeding, neither of which was pending at this time.   You also tend to show it was done for a corrupt, or corruptly, to use the statutory term. This doesn t meet the usual definition of that. ",politics,2017/5/17,0

Gutfeld then compared the use of  hope  to desiring a bicycle for Christmas, wanting people to show up for your birthday, and asking neighbors to be quiet while you re sleeping. In my mind   it seems like it s not a big deal, which is maybe why Comey didn t think it was obstructionist, so he didn t have to comply to reporting it, because he knew   what Trump was doing is what Trump does. Everything to him is like visiting a construction site. It s not what a politician says or does. He doesn t understand how internal stuff works.

I spoke to him (Lavrov) today,  a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. I ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russia s intelligence services. It was very bad of him.

The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.

Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Just as in the Rich case, several of the people who died mysterious deaths were shot spontaneously and in public places, sometimes from behind, sometimes by unknown assailants and often just before they were set to release incriminating evidence concerning the Clintons  activities. In most cases, there were no signs of theft at the crime scenes. And while some of the deaths were ruled suicides, other cases remain a mystery.Rich worked for the Democratic National Committee as a data analyst and reportedly sent more than 44,000 DNC emails to WikiLeaks, including 17,761 attachments, from January 2015 through the end of May 2016. As WND reported, the DNC staffer had been in contact with WikiLeaks Director Gavin MacFadyen, who died just 17 days before the election of lung cancer.Rich was mysteriously shot and killed July 10, 2016. As WND reported, Rich was murdered near his affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He was shot in the back with a handgun at 4:18 a.m. while he walked home, and nothing was taken from him. Rich, who called several people as he later walked home, was talking on the phone with his girlfriend, Kelsey Murka, when he was accosted a block from his house. He was transported to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 5:57 a.m. If it was a robbery it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money, he still has his credit cards, still had his phone, so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,  said Rich s father, Joel, shortly after the bizarre murder.On July 22, just 12 days after Rich s death and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails from DNC officials.Those leaked emails revealed, among other things, that the DNC tried to tip the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton s campaign and prevent Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from becoming the party s nominee. The leaks were cited by some Democrats as one explanation for Clinton s election loss. Many accused the Russians of  hacking  and turning the tide for then-GOP candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election.In one email released by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said he d like to  make an example  out of the person who leaked the emails. I m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it,  Podesta wrote on Feb. 22, 2015, according to WikiLeaks.Only days after Rich s murder, Hillary Clinton cited the DNC staffer s death in her speech advocating for more gun control. From Sandy Hook to Orlando to Dallas, and so many other places, these tragedies tear at our soul,  Clinton said in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on July 12.  And so do the incidents that don t even dominate the headlines. Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich, who worked for the Democratic National Committee to expand voting rights, was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old.   Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America. The bizarre shooting of Rich shares some similarities with other murders listed in WND s exclusive report,  Clinton death list : 33 spine-tingling cases.  Many of the individuals included in the list were shot to death, though some of the deaths were ruled to be suicides. Others were killed in plane crashes, car wrecks and freak accidents.Vince Foster was deputy White House counsel and Hillary s friend and law partner who had connections to the Clintons  Travelgate and Whitewater scandals. In 1993, Foster was found dead in a park with a fatal gunshot wound to his mouth. As WND reported, his suicide was the subject of much speculation and three official investigations.Investigations by the U.S. Park Police, the Department of Justice, the FBI, Congress, Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr concluded Foster s death was a suicide. However, as WND reported in 2003, one of Starr s key investigators challenged the official line, insisting the probe s result was predetermined, only a few plotters were required to engineer the result, the crime scene was altered and that major newspaper editors killed stories by reporters pursuing the truth. The Washington Post reported that federal investigators were not allowed to enter Foster s office after his death, but  White House aides enter[ed] Foster s office shortly after his death, giving rise to speculation that files were removed from his office. In his 2005 book  The Truth about Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, And How Far She ll Go to Become President,  Edward Klein wrote of Hillary s involvement in the effort to remove Foster s files:As WND reported in February 2016, recently discovered evidence unearthed from boxes stored deep in the National Archives lend credence to theories about foul play and cover-up that have been hinted at by at least three books and countless articles.The newest piece to the puzzle was uncovered by two citizen researchers, one of whom was a witness involved in the case from the beginning. What had only been suspicions about missing death-scene photographs are now listed as facts in public documents.The smoking-gun information comes from two documents: a two-page letter of resignation and a 31-page memo both written by Starr s lead prosecutor, Miguel Rodriguez.Rodriguez refers in his letter to photographs showing a wound on Foster s neck   a wound that did not exist according to accounts in Starr s official government report.The obvious questions: How could a suicide victim be found with two wounds   a .38-caliber gunshot into the mouth that exited through his head and another wound on the right side of his neck that one of the paramedics described as a small-caliber bullet hole? And why would the government investigators go to great lengths to cover it up?Jerry Luther Parks: Shot in chest by mysterious gunmanTwo months after Foster died, Jerry Luther Parks   who had been head of security for Bill Clinton s headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, during the 1992 presidential campaign and gubernatorial years  was shot through the rear window of his car with a semiautomatic handgun.As WND reported, Jerry Luther Parks was reportedly watching a news bulletin on the death of Foster when he turned from the television and muttered,  I m a dead man. His son, Gary, was with him in the room. It was July 21, 1993. Foster had just been found dead in Fort Marcy Park, about seven miles from the White House, across the Potomac River in Virginia. Foster had been shot through the head, said the bulletin, an apparent suicide.British journalist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard interviewed the Parks family extensively. In  The Secret Life of Bill Clinton,  he reported that Parks was a nervous wreck for the next two months. He packed a gun and drove evasively to shake off any possible pursuers. At one point, Parks told his family that Bill Clinton was  cleaning house  and that he was  next on the list. On Sept. 23, 1993, as Parks was driving to his suburban Little Rock home along the Chenal Parkway, a white Chevrolet Caprice with two men inside drove alongside and peppered Parks  car with semiautomatic gunfire. Parks  car ground to a halt. A man emerged from the white Chevy, fired two rounds into Parks  chest with a 9-mm pistol, then sped off.Several witnesses watched the murder. The killers were never found. As with so many other  Arkancides    the name given to the long list of suspicious deaths among Arkansas associates of the Clintons   Big Media ignored the event.One of the last people to see Foster alive was Linda Tripp, who then worked as a secretary for Foster s boss, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. Tripp testified before Kenneth Starr s grand jury on July 28, 1998, that the reason she had leaked Monica Lewinsky s story to Michael Isikoff at Newsweek was that Tripp hoped the spotlight of national publicity might protect her from physical harm. I am afraid of this administration,  Tripp told the grand jury.She continued:  I have what I consider to be well-founded fears of what they are capable of   I had reasons to believe that the Vince Foster tragedy was not depicted accurately under oath by members of the administration   I knew based on personal knowledge, personal observations, that they were lying under oath. So it became very fearful to me that I had information even back then that was dangerous. A juror asked,  But do you have any examples of violence being done by the administration to people who were a threat to them? Tripp named Jerry Parks:  [T]he behavior in the West Wing with senior staff to the president during the time the Jerry Parks [murder report] came over the fax frightened me. He had been killed, she said.The  flurry of activity,  the closed-door meetings and the  hush-hush  atmosphere in the White House all struck her as ominous and frightening. Maybe you had to be there,  said Tripp. [The news of Parks  death] was something they wanted to get out in front of. There was talk that this would be another body to add to the list of 40 bodies or something that were associated with the Clinton administration. At that time, I didn t know what that meant. I have since come to see such a list. After the murder, Gary Parks told a staffer of the New York Observer his father and Vince Foster had investigated Clinton s affairs at Hillary s request. He said that Vince Foster had called up his father, who was working as a private investigator, to look into Clinton s romantic life in about 1980, after Bill Clinton had lost the governor s office following his first term. Parks said Hillary wanted a divorce. It looked like maybe the juggernaut she d believed in, and married, was over. Clinton had by then lost two big races and won two. Till the Comeback Kid   boy is Bill Clinton gutsy   won back the governorship in 1982. But in the early 80s, Parks said, Hillary asked her law partner Vince Foster to prepare a divorce case and Foster called Parks, who compiled a dossier of women s statements. Parks said that Hillary later decided against a divorce, but that his father held on to the dossier. Then in 1993, Parks said, after Vince Foster went to Washington, he demanded the return of the file, and even called Jerry Parks in the days before his, Foster s, death, to demand it. And that two months later his father was murdered, because, Parks said, he had held out on returning the file. (The L.R. police never solved his father s murder, not when I was looking into it a few years afterward.) John Hillyer: Mysterious timing of deathNBC cameraman John Hillyer had been working on an investigation of a drug-smuggling operation in Mena, Arkansas, while Clinton was the state s governor. He also helped with a 30-minute video called  Circle of Power  and  The Clinton Chronicles. As WND reported, video journalist Pat Matrisciana (producer of  The Clinton Chronicles ) began working on the film project in the early 1990s, he didn t realize what he and his cameraman were getting into. I had been contacted by a man named John Hillyer, an NBC cameraman who wanted to tell the real story about what was happening in Arkansas,  he said.When Matrisciana and Hillyer arrived in Arkansas and began interviewing people for the video, the criminality and intrigue were far worse than they had imagined. It was like going into some sort of banana republic that was run by a dictatorship,  he said.  We were followed on a regular basis. Matrisciana set up a  safe house  in an apartment complex in Little Rock where he and other journalists and investigators would meet to discuss stories of drug trafficking in Mena, the murder of two teenage boys there and whether or not Bill Clinton was involved in any of those activities.Hillyer and Matrisciana developed a friendship with Gary Parks, the son of Jerry Luther Parks, a former security chief of Clinton s presidential campaign. According to Matrisciana, Jerry Parks had been hired several years earlier by Foster on behalf of Hillary Clinton to put Bill Clinton under constant surveillance. Gary would go on surveillance stakeouts with his father as Jerry gathered photographic evidence of Clinton visiting with prostitutes, Gennifer Flowers and other women.When Foster s body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Jerry became paranoid that he might also be targeted for murder. He was right. When Jerry was assassinated in his car in September 1993, Gary and Jerry s widow believed it was related to his surveillance of Clinton.Gary Parks regularly stayed at the safe house, but was awakened one night when the door was kicked open by would-be assassins. When he quickly loaded his M-1 carbine, the sound of the bullet being chambered scared off the killers and they fled into the parking lot. Gary went to the window and thought he recognized one of the men as a member of the Gov. Clinton s security staff.On another occasion, when Matrisciana and others were preparing for a radio talk show at the safe house, an investigator scanned the apartment for  bugs  and discovered eight of them.During the course of their investigation, Matrisciana and Hillyer discovered a trail of unsolved murders of people who knew details about the teens  deaths. Others who died mysteriously had inside information on drug ties to the political establishment in Arkansas. On one occasion, Hillyer was planning to conduct an interview with a former official of the Democratic National Committee, but the man never showed up for the interview. Hillyer learned the next day that the man, C. Victor Raiser II, and his son, Montgomery Raiser, had died in a plane crash.Matrisciana and Hillyer were also going to interview a hermit who lived in the mountains near where the teens had been killed. Two days before the scheduled interview, the hermit died.Hillyer started to fear for his own life, telling Matrisciana that he thought they would kill him by making it look like he had a heart attack. After the film was completed, Hillyer went on to other projects and ended up living in Atlanta. In 1996, Matrisciana received a phone call from Hillyer. John told him he had uncovered new information that needed to be put on video, but that they couldn t talk on an unsecured phone. They planned on meeting to discuss the new information, but Hillyer died of a heart attack three days later, on Nov. 29, 1996.Did someone get to Hillyer? Matrisciana doesn t know. Were the hermit and DNC official killed for what they knew? Or were these simply coincidences? Again, Matriciana said he doesn t know, but he did think the deaths were unusual, considering the number of other people who have died under mysterious circumstances in Arkansas.Blacklisted News -On July 3, attorney Shawn Lucas, 38, helped serve the DNC with a lawsuit claiming then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz  rigged the primary for Hillary Clinton. The complaint was served before Wasserman Schultz resigned amid the Wikileaks email scandal on July 24.Less than one month after he helped serve the lawsuit, Lucas  girlfriend found him dead in his bathroom.Beverly Ann Fields, chief of staff at the Washington, D.C., Medical Examiner s office, told WND,  The cause and manner of death for decedent [Shawn] Lucas are still pending. Victor Thorn authored four books on the Clintons:  Hillary (and Bill): The Sex Volume,  Hillary (and Bill): The Drugs Volume,   Hillary (and Bill): The Murder Volume  and  Crowning Clinton: Why Hillary Shouldn t Be in the White House.  Thorn reportedly committed suicide with a gun on his 54th birthday on a mountaintop in Pennsylvania.Inquisitr reported that Thorn made several appearances on  The Russell Scott Show  and told the host,  Russell, if I m ever found dead, it was murder. I would never kill myself. As WND reported, Joe Montano, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee before Debbie Wasserman Schultz and was an aide to Hillary s running-mate, Tim Kaine, reportedly died of a heart attack after the Wikileaks DNC email dump. Montano was only 47.Former United Nations General Assembly President John Ashe was found dead in His New York home, and the cause of death was reported as a heart attack, as WND reported. But the local Dobbs Ferry police said  his throat had been crushed, presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron. The death by barbell of disgraced U.N. official John Ashe could become a bigger obsession for conspiracy theorists than Vince Foster s 1993 suicide,  the report by Richard Johnson said.It s because Ashe was scheduled to testify in just days with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, who was accused of smuggling $4.5 million into the U.S. and lying that it was to buy casino chips and more.The New York Post said Ng earlier was identified in a 1998 Senate document  as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner, Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration. One source told me,  Johnson wrote,  During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed. Gareth Williams, a transatlantic MI6 spy   whose dead body was found naked, padlocked and stuffed in a 32-inch by 19-inch duffel bag that was sitting in his London bathtub   had illegally hacked secret data on Bill Clinton, according to the U.K. Sun. The news site noted,  [H]is death is still one of Britain s most mysterious unsolved cases. Scotland Yard had announced the death as a suicide, saying he locked himself in the bag.But his DNA wasn t found on the lock. There were no palm prints on the edge of his bathtub.For the entire chilling list of people who crossed the Clinton s and ended up dead, go to WND ",politics,2017/5/16,0

0675,"CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founderâ€¦DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To â€œStand Downâ€?On Case [VIDEO]","Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.

According to Pai, he and other commissioners were told not to reveal the details of its investigation until April 1, a day after the FCC voted to expand the Lifeline program.

That s not right. Pai did not say who issued that directive. However, it had the effect of preventing public knowledge of widespread fraud in the Lifeline program ahead of a contentious vote on expanding it despite persisting concerns about a lack of internal safeguards.FCC spokesman Will Wiquist insisted that the timing was completely coincidental.

He began to discuss allegations Senator Rand Paul and another senator were under surveillance by the Obama administration but dropped a bomb on the Obama administration spying on the US Supreme Court.Judge Napolitano: Justice Scalia told me that he often thought the court was being surveilled. And he told me that probably four or five years ago If they had to unmask Senator Paul s name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that. That s not what he s talking about. They re talking about unmasking him when he s having a conversation with his campaign manager when he s running in the Republican primary.During the discussion Judge Napolitano also said Barack Obama could be subpoenaed to testify if he viewed the unmasked intelligence.,politics,2017/5/15,0

His tenure was marked by the Edward Snowden leaks on US intelligence. He s always said he d resign at the end of Obama s presidency but we re wondering if he s jumping before Trump appointees arrive. Clapper and Gen. Mike Flynn have a history that s not so perfect:Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some  niceties,  I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me).I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot.I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department. After being fired, I left the meeting thinking,  Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.

Watch more tomorrow on #MTP pic.twitter.com/PZnrqCZpAh  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) May 13, 2017FULL INTERVIEW:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lznEK71d9z4FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE INTERVIEW: CHUCK TODD:When President Trump fired James Comey, a lot of Democrats jumped to the collection that the president was trying to stymie the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. And on Thursday, the president told NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt that he was thinking of, quote,  This Russia thing,  when he made his decision. Yesterday, I sat down with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and I began by asking him whether he agrees with the president that the Russia story is fake news and a witch hunt.SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, the president I think has made it clear that he feels it s important that we reengage with Russia. The relationship with Russia, as he has described, and I have described as well, is I think at an all-time low point since the end of the Cold War, with a very low level of trust.I think the world, and it s in the interest of the American people, it s in the interest of Russia, the rest of the world, that we do something to see if we cannot improve the relationship between the two greatest nuclear powers in the world. So the president, I think, is committed to at least make an effort in that regard, and he has certainly asked me to make an important effort as well.CHUCK TODD:I understand that, but you look at what s happened in these Western European nations, in France and the U.K., in Germany, Italy. Accusations of Russian interference in their democratic process. What message does it send to those countries that their number one ally, the United States, the president fired the man at the agency that was looking into the very problem they re dealing with, Russian interference in the democracy?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, what I hear from the leaders of the other nations, Europe and more broadly, and the subject of Russia comes up in all of our conversations, is all the other nations want the U.S. and Russia to work towards improving our relationship as well, for all the reasons that I just mentioned.I think it s largely viewed that it is not healthy for the world. It s certainly not healthy for us, for the American people, our national security interest and otherwise, for this relationship to remain at this low level. Whether we can improve it or not remains to be seen.It s going to take some time. It s going to take a lot of hard work. But I think the president s committed, rightly so, and I m committed with him as well, to see if we cannot do something to put us on a better footing in our relationship with Russia.CHUCK TODD:Can you get on a better footing with them if you don t address this issue of the Russian interference? I mean your counterpart, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov, said that you guys didn t even talk about this issue of Russian interference in our election because, as he put it, President Trump himself says it s fake news, so it s not an issue. Why haven t you brought it up with them?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, I think we have such a broad range of important issues that have to be addressed in the U.S.-Russia relationship. Obviously the interference in the election is one of those. I think it s been well documented, it s pretty well understood, the nature of that interference, here and elsewhere.And you know, these are not new tactics on the part of the Russian government, directed not only at us but at others. But again, I think we have to look at this relationship in its broadest contours, and there are many, many important areas which require our attention if we are to bring it back to a relationship that we believe is necessary for the security of the U.S.CHUCK TODD:Mr. Secretary, though. This is fundamental. They interfered with our democracy. I just don t understand how this is not a top issue for you to deal with with them in order to, essentially, start with a clean slate. Can t start with a clean slate until maybe they either own up to what they did, or we punish them in a way that they re not going to do this again.SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, I think it s important to understand we re not trying to start with a clean slate. I think terms like having a reset are overused. You cannot reset. You cannot erase the past. You cannot start with a clean slate. And we re not trying to start with a clean slate.We re starting with the slate we have. And all the problems that are on that slate. We don t dismiss any of them. We don t give anyone a free pass on any of them. They re part of the entire nature of the discussion we re having with the Russians. And yes, there are a large number of issues that we have to get around to addressing in order to put this relationship back together, if that is indeed possible.CHUCK TODD:During your confirmation hearings you made clear you didn t have  obviously you hadn t been briefed on the intelligence reports, the 17 different agencies that came to the conclusions that the Russians did make an effort to interfere in this election. Obviously there s an investigation going along to see if there was any collusion in this interference. Since you ve become Secretary of State in February, have you been briefed? Have you seen this intelligence now? Is it clear in your mind that it is a fact the Russians interfered in our elections?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:I have seen the intelligence reports, Chuck, and yes, I don t think there s any question that the Russians were playing around in our electoral processes. Again, as those intelligence reports also have indicated, it s inconclusive as to what, if any, effect it had.CHUCK TODD:I understand about the impact, but the fact that they got into it, what should the repercussions be now, in your mind?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, they re just part of that broader landscape of conversations, Chuck. And I think, you know, the real impact is it serves yet again to undermine the trust between the United States and Russia. And as I have said, and the president has said, you know, we re just at a very, very low level of trust between our two countries right now. And so what we re exploring is how do we begin the process of restoring that trust. And ultimately it will touch on all of these issues.CHUCK TODD:I want to give you a chance to respond to an op-ed that Senator John McCain wrote, where he invoked your name, sir. He said this.  In a recent address to State Department employees Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said,  Conditioning our foreign policy too heavily on values creates obstacles to advance our national interests.' McCain goes on to write,  With those words, Secretary Tillerson sent a message to oppressed people everywhere,  Don t look to the United States for hope. Our values make us sympathetic to your plight, and when it s convenient we might officially express that sympathy.'  Some pretty tough words from Senator McCain. What do you say in response?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, first, I d say if anyone has earned the right to express their views, Senator McCain has. And I have great respect for the senator. I think the point that I was making, Chuck, in that message to State Department employees is an important one to understand.And that s that America s values of freedom, of treatment of people, human dignity, freedom of expression throughout the world, those are our values. Those are enduring values. They are part of everything we do. And in fact they serve as the guidepost and they serve as the boundaries as we develop our foreign policy approaches and our diplomatic efforts.But I make a distinction between values and policy. A policy has to be tailored to the individual situation. To the country. To its circumstances. To the broader issues that we are addressing in terms of advancing our national security interest, our national economic interest.And so policies have to be adaptable. They have to change. They have to adjust to conditions. But our values can never change. Our values can never be put in a position of having to be compromised. And so the values guide our policy, but if we put our values in the front of our policies and say,  This is our policy,  we have no room to adapt to changing circumstances to achieve our ultimate objective. And I think if we are successful in achieving our ultimate diplomatic and national security objectives, we will create the conditions for the advancement of freedom in countries all over the world.CHUCK TODD:Secretary Tillerson, I know you re busy and you ve got to get going. You ve got this big trip ahead of you. Thank you for spending some time with us. I appreciate it.",politics,2017/5/14,0

It s pretty sad when your governor can t even enforce laws already on the books. Pitiful!Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday signed a law targeting so-called  sanctuary cities  that allows police to ask about a person s immigration status and threatens sheriffs with jail if they don t cooperate with federal authorities.He signed the bill on Facebook today:Governor Abbott stated before signing the bill:  Let s be clear about something. We all support legal immigration. It helped to build America and Texas. Legal immigration is different from harboring people who have committed dangerous crimes. This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won t be tolerated in Texas. Abbott, a Republican in his first term, took the unusual step of signing the bill on Facebook with no advanced public notice. He said Texas residents expect lawmakers to  keep us safe  and said similar laws have already been tested in federal court, where opponents have already been hinting the bill will be immediately challenged. Texas has now banned sanctuary cities in the Lone Star State,  Abbott said.We couldn t be happier about this!The bill cleared a final hurdle this week in the Republican-controlled Legislature over objections from Democrats and immigrant rights supporters who ve packed the Texas Capitol. They call it a  show-me-your-papers  measure that will be used to discriminate against Latinos.Every major police chief in Texas opposed the bill. Republicans say it is needed to ensure local jails honor requests from federal officials to keep dangerous offenders behind bars.The Texas bill allows police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they detain, a situation that can range from arrest for a crime to being stopped for a traffic violation.This is HUGE!Attorney General Jeff Sessions also put sanctuary cities on notice.

0692,REPORT: PRESIDENT TRUMP To Replace Sean Spicer With FOX News Personality,"It s no secret that President Trump is very much a hands-on type of manager. Should anyone really be surprised by the firing and hiring of people in his inner-circle, as he assesses their job performances, to ensure the most qualified people are in place for key positions of his administration? The next couple of weeks should be interesting as Trump figures out which direction he ll go with press briefings, and who, if anyone, will represent him as a trusted and competent spokesperson. The inside scoop from Infowars, is that he s already made that decision White House sources have told Infowars that Sean Spicer could be fired within the next week as President Trump begins a purge of establishment advisers who he feels have failed to properly investigate leaks coming from within the administration.Speculation is already swirling as to whether or not Spicer will return after he was  benched  and temporarily replaced with Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Spicer has behaved like a  deer in the headlights  in recent weeks and is not able to handle the pressure of the job, according to one source.They add that Spicer will be gone by next week and that former prosecutor and current Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was previously considered for the role, is currently the favorite to replace him.   InfowarsBack in October, she was seen entering Trump Tower and rumors began swirling she was up for a position on the communications team. By December, the speculation hit its fever pitch and political observers were sure Guilfoyle would be involved with the operation somehow, whether as press secretary or in an ancillary role. Even some of her Fox News colleagues spoke out in favor of her heading to the White House.Still, a New York Times report yesterday said,  while Mr. Trump has raised the Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle to allies as a possible press secretary, he has spent several hours with Mr. Spicer this week, praising his television  ratings  during the briefings. Though Trump has been claiming he wants to stop the briefings, his actions indicate otherwise. Who knows, but maybe we ll see Guilfoyle at that podium sooner than we think. The only question left then would be who will play her on Saturday Night Live?A report from the AP out today also notes that  Trump is mulling expanding the communications team and has eyed hiring producers from Fox News.  -Mediaite",politics,2017/5/14,0

Who hasn t read or heard something totally false about Trump and Russia? This past week was a banner week of lies from the main stream media so it s our pleasure to straighten things out for everyone We ve discovered a star news reporting organization that stands above most others in their reporting on the Trump/Russia investigation. CIRCA NEWS with Sara Carter and John Solomon are setting the record straight!Here s the skinny on the latest media lies and the truth via Circa:Aggressive news reporting can be a public service, like when courageous journalists exposed Richard Nixon s Watergate, the Catholic church s cover up of the sexual abuse and the U.S. intelligence failures that preceded 9-11.But breathless, half-baked reporting in times of tumult can also misserve the public, like when The Wall Street Journal retracted a false story that Bill Clinton had been seen in a compromising position with an intern in the White House or when NBC wrongly identified Richard Jewell as the Olympic Park bombing suspect.This past week, professional journalism offered us several new examples of breathless reporting during the brouhaha over Donald Trump, James Comey and Russia intelligence. At their least, some stories misled the public, and at their worst they outright misinformed.Here are some examples this week that should cause the media to search whether its current standards are doing enough to ensure the public gets the whole truth. You can review the facts and decide for yourself whether the media shamed itself.The Rosenstein  Quitting Episode The Washington Post reported Wednesday night that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had  threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey. The story cited an unnamed source close to the White House. But it did not have any comment or confirmation from the man who was alleged to have made the threat.When Sinclair Broadcast Group s Michelle Macaluso finally caught up to Rosenstein, a funny thing happened. He debunked the story. No, I m not quitting,  he said.The reporter pressed on:  Did you threaten to quit? No,  Rosenstein said.The Post did not return a call for comment Friday on whether it stood by its story.The Comey resources requestThe New York Times and several other outlets reported Wednesday that Comey, just before he was fired, had asked the Justice Department s Rosenstein for more funding and personnel for the Russia intelligence probe. But when Comey s deputy got to Capitol Hill the next day, he denied there was any need for more resources. I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately,  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told lawmakers.McCabe said the FBI, if it needed more resources, wouldn t even go to the Justice Department but instead to Congress.  We don t typically request resources for an individual case,  he explained.CNN s claim that Trump  is under investigation During the breaking story on Comey Tuesday night, respected CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin declared the FBI director s firing was a  grotesque abuse of power  and that it was a  political act when the President is under investigation. Toobin is entitled to his opinion but he should have the right facts. Numerous sources confirm to Circa that Comey told Congress just last week that Trump is NOT a target of the Russia probe.CNN s connection of grand jury subpoenas to Comey s firingCNN went live with an exclusive the night Comey was fired, reporting that grand jury subpoenas were issued to associates of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records in the Russia case.But with one slight turn of hand, CNN s legitimate scoop was crafted to suggest there had been some correlation to Comey s firing. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey,  the network reported.The multitude of media comparisons to WatergateCountless media outlets from Politico and The New York Times to Mother Jones have suggested the whole Russia scandal is akin to Watergate, right down to Comey s firing mirroring Nixon s efforts to axe the special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.There s just one problem with that. Nixon was the target of the Watergate probe and he was accused of specific crimes.Via: Circa New/John Solomon",politics,2017/5/13,0
0697,â€œSHEâ€™S NO PUSHOVERâ€? How Sarah Huckabee Sanders Made It To The White House Podium,"Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders found herself behind the briefing room lectern last Wednesday fielding questions about the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the investigation into Russia s involvement in the 2016 campaign.Her calm, cool and collected approach to rapid-fire questioning stood in stark contrast to that of Sean Spicer s  brash mannerisms.But Sanders isn t a soft pushover, and she can hold her own   as evidenced by her approach to Thursday s briefing. Sanders often sighed and lamented that she had to repeat herself, answering reporters  questions regarding Comey s firing with,  I think I ve already answered this. Sanders  approach to handling the press is due to years of political upbringing, her father told Fox News in an interview. And for those who might not recognize her face, Sanders  maiden name, Huckabee, is a dead giveaway for just what kind of political upbringing that was.Family MattersThe daughter of former two-time Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders grew up in politics in a way that many kids don t, Huckabee said. I always say that when most kids are 7 or 8 years old out jumping rope, she was sitting at the kitchen table listening to [political commentators] analyze poll results,  he said.Sanders was consistently ingrained in her father s own political aspirations, serving as his field director for his 2002 gubernatorial reelection campaign and national political director during his 2008 presidential bid. In 2016, she ran his presidential campaign.But it was growing up in the Arkansas governor s mansion as a young teenager that prepared Sanders for her current role as deputy press secretary, Huckabee said.Huckabee became governor in the summer of 1996 as the then-Democratic Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was convicted of fraud. Huckabee describes the transition and the media during that time as  hostile  and  brutal  as the legislature was the  most lopsided in the country    worse than that of Massachusetts or Maine, he said. At the time, Huckabee said, Sanders was in junior high school. [Sanders] saw how utterly unfair and petty the press can be for even simple things,  Huckabee said.  So having grown up with that, I think people don t understand   it s not just that she presents a sort of sense of being beyond it; she really is. She s seen it her whole life. But Huckabee also credits his daughter s poise behind the briefing room podium to another familial matter   growing up with two older brothers. She grew up pretty doggone tough. She had to, as a matter of survival,  Huckabee said.  She s got a very sweet heart, but she s tough, and she can handle herself. She s had to take all kinds of gruff from her brothers, so she s pretty fearless. Huckabee added that as his youngest child   and his only daughter at that   Sanders was at time spoiled by her parents. But even still, the Huckabees sought to instill a spirit of hard work in all the children, he said. She s always been raised to tell the truth, take responsibility for her own actions, to work hard for what she wants in life. Even as teenagers, when they went to things like church camp, we wouldn t pay their tuition,  he said.  We told them that they needed to work in the cafeteria or snack bar to cover their costs   not because it was absolutely necessary, but because we wanted them to understand and appreciate that everything costs something. Road to the White HouseHuckabee describes his daughter as the type who was always ambitious. Like him, Sanders attended Ouachita Baptist University, a private liberal arts school in southwest Arkansas where she was student body president.Following college, Sanders took a job at the Department of Education under the Bush administration, according to a 2007 profile in Time. She s always been raised to tell the truth, take responsibility for her own actions, to work hard for what she wants in life.  Sanders  resume includes a bevy of GOP campaigns: working on former President George W. Bush s reelection campaign in 2004, acting as a senior advisor to Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton s Senate bid and managing other Arkansas Sen. John Boozman s bid for Senate.Outside of campaigning, Sanders worked as a national campaign manager for Bono s ONE Campaign, the grassroots advocacy organization aimed at ending poverty.She also cofounded the political consulting firm in Little Rock, Second Street Strategies, which her husband is also involved with.In 2010, Sanders was named to Time s 40 Under 40 list along with longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, civil rights leader Ben Jealous and Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich.But it was after Huckabee s withdrawal from the Republican-heavy field of presidential candidates in February 2016 when Sanders was tapped by the Trump campaign as a senior advisor and eventual on-air surrogate. I volunteered to join Mr. Trump s campaign because he is a champion of working families, not Washington-Wall Street elites,  Sanders said in a statement released by the campaign at the time.Her statement added praise for Trump s anti-abortion and  pro-marriage  stance.Next StepsAs Sanders has gained more notoriety in the Trump administration   often appearing on camera to defend the president s actions and agenda   rumors circulated among journalists and White House aides about her future in the Trump administration.Her time behind the podium this week in Spicer s absence could be an audition for his job, anonymous White House aides reportedly told Politico. We re all under the impression that Sanders is auditioning for a greater role in the Trump administration and don t rule out Spicer s job,  a White House aide told Fox News in response to the Politico report.But Sanders dismissed the idea as just  another ridiculous story.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017It s unclear whether Trump was warning that the White House is recording his calls, or if he believes the FBI may have been recording Comey s.Trump said Thursday during an interview with NBC News that the two men have spoken at least three times since Inauguration Day.Watch President Trump tell NBC s Lester Holt he was going to fire Comey anyway:And on those occasions, he insisted, Comey assured him that he was not personally the subject of any federal investigations. He said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone calls,  Trump said.He described a matter-of-fact exchange over dinner in which he asked an unusual question and got an unconventional response. I said,  If it s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation?  Trump recalled. He said,  You are not under investigation . It is rare for a federal law enforcement official to tell anyone, including the President of the United States, whether they are being investigated.Even if Comey doesn t speak to reporters about the circumstances behind his dismissal on Tuesday, he may have a high-profile venue to tell his side of the story.The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked him to testify next week.The latest twist from Trump amid reports that he demanded loyalty from James Comey during the private dinner at the White House back in January.The claims from associates of the now fired FBI director. Comey had told associates that he was summoned to the White House for a one-on-one dinner with Trump seven days after the inauguration, the New York Times reports.It was during the dinner that Trump reportedly asked Comey twice to pledge loyalty to him as the new Commander in Chief.Sources claim Comey declined to do so but said he told the President he would always be honest with him.Trump is said to have pressed Comey on whether that would be  honest loyalty , to which the FBI director said:  You will have that.  Sources close to Comey said he now believes this dinner conversation may have sealed his fate.This version of events is vastly different to the dinner conversation Trump himself described in an interview with NBC s Lester Holt on Thursday.The version is denied by the White House. But the president also used Twitter on Friday morning to say that  it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy .While it is not clear if they are talking about the same dinner, the pair are believed to have only dined together privately once.Trump indicated that he had dinner with Comey at the former FBI director s request   and said Comey was angling to keep his job. I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House,  Trump said. He asked for the dinner?  Holt followed up. A dinner was arranged, I think he asked for the dinner,  the president hedged.  And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I ll consider and we ll see what happens. But we had a very nice dinner. And at that time he told me  you are not under investigation ,  Trump said.Trump said he had asked Comey   once over dinner and twice by phone   if the FBI were investigating him as part of its probe into alleged collusion between members of his campaign and the Russian government prior to the election.The President showed no concern that the request might be viewed as interference in the active FBI probe.Comey has not spoken publicly to confirm or challenge Trump s account.During that same interview, Trump declared he had planned to fire Comey all along, regardless of whether top Justice Department officials recommended the stunning step.The White House had initially cited a Justice Department memo criticizing Comey s handling of last year s investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails as the impetus for Trump s decision.For entire story-Daily Mail",politics,2017/5/12,0

The whole idea of free speech is that we have a free speech area on campus, kay?  Professor Gregory Thatcher erroneously declares in a video recorded by the school s Students for Life chapter.  Free speech is free speech in the free speech area. It s a pretty simple concept, okay? This does not constitute a free speech area, okay?

This is our part of free speech. Do you disagree with our part of free speech?  Thatcher asked while erasing one of the club s messages, after which he proclaimed that  college campuses are not free speech areas. The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) has since filed a lawsuit against Thatcher on behalf of the Students for Life chapter at Fresno State, arguing that his efforts to intimidate and harass members of the Student for Life chapter violated their fundamental right to free speech.***WARNING***The video you are about to see will make your blood boil. It s pretty hard to watch a full grown man employed by Fresno College sending female students out to do his dirty work. It s even harder to watch the way he aggressively approaches this young female pro-life student, while arrogantly explaining to her that he has the right to deny her free-speech in America Fresno State Students for Life received full permission to chalk pro-life messages near the library. Rather than countering with his own message, Dr. Thatcher took the illegal approach of censoring speech and inciting students to help in this,  Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, remarked in a press release, claiming that no student  should have to endure this kind of intimidation and harassment for simply expressing their views.

They yelled over her speech, they even turned their backs on her. For 25 minutes the students at Bethune Cookman reminded us just how far Obama has divided our nation.A sophomore student at Bethune-Cookman, a historically black university, filmed himself running around with his phone as he yelled for the seniors to stand and rebuke Betsy DeVos during her commencement speech. He implored the graduating seniors to disrupt her speech by yelling and standing with their backs to  DeVos, who bravely persevered through her speech in spite of their embarrassing behavior.The student, who says his name is  Bobbie Luke  and identifies himself as a  StuPid NiGGA  on his Twitter account, was eventually thrown out of the venue by campus security.CNN breathlessly followed the student as he was being thrown out, hoping to get an intelligent response from the student about why he was whipping the graduating seniors into a frenzy over Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  commencement speech.

0721,"CLASS ACT: Watch Betsy DeVos Respond While Students At Black College Yell, Heckle, Turn Backs On Her During Commencement Speech [VIDEO]","Betsy DeVos just proved to America why President Trump chose her among so many qualified candidates to reform our broken education system. Full-grown men would have crumbled under the kind of pressure and hate she was facing during her graceful commencement speech. Let s face it, most of us would have walked off the stage, but Betsy DeVos, firm in her resolution to deliver the speech she was invited to share, stood at the podium, and against all odds, addressed an angry group of students railing against  the injustice  at a college where 95% of the students receive some form of state or federal grant money.During the roughly 25-minute speech, DeVos took time to address the criticism that s come her way since she was unveiled as the university s graduation speaker, telling the crowd it was important to converse with and learn from people despite disagreements.The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,  DeVos said.  But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak   with humility   to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don t immediately or instinctively agree,  she continued.While DeVos spoke, the students continued to heckle and yell over DeVos as she persevered through her speech. The University president who was clearly embarrassed by the behavior of the graduates finally stepped up to the microphone to address the students in hopes of getting the disrespectful group under control telling them,  If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you wanna go.  He then implored the students to be seated.The students chose to continue with their embarrassing behavior, at which time DeVos began to once again address the crowd:Many Bethune-Cookman University students, alumni and supporters made their disapproval of DeVos  appearance known well before she took the stage.On Tuesday, Bethune-Cookman University students and alumni delivered thousands of signatures to the school s president, Edison O. Jackson, and the university s Board of Trustees in a last-ditch effort to try and change their minds about inviting DeVos to speak.DeVos, a West Michigan native, initially drew ire from students and supporters from historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, throughout the country after she connected HBCUs to the school choice movement in February. MLiveDeVos recently met with presidents and chancellors of historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, at the White House. Following that meeting, she said in a statement that a key priority for the administration was to help develop opportunities for underserved communities, and praised HBCUs for fulfilling that mission all along. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,  she said in the statement.  They saw that the system wasn t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. DeVos continued:  HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Critics were quick to point out on social media that HBCUs were initially founded in part because black students often did not have the option to enroll in existing public institutions in the South.Others noted public HBCUs were generally not offered the same amount of funding and resources predominantly white colleges and universities received.In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education about the controversy, Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough said similar comments she made in the listening session  didn t come across as ill-spirited,  but was a poor analogy. I think she was honestly trying to find a way to connect her experience with HBCUs,  he told The Chronicle of Higher Education.  MLive ",politics,2017/5/11,0

0726,MEDIA IGNORES Time That Bill Clinton FIRED His FBI Director On Day Before Vince Foster Was Found Dead,"In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.",politics,2017/5/10,0

In his letter to Comet, President Trump stated that he believed FBI Director James Comey was  not able to effectively lead the Bureau.  Deputy Attorney General Rod J.Rosenstein blamed Comey s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case. Attorney General Sessions agreed with Rosenstein saying  a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI. In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT sCoincidence?President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William S. Sessions on July  19, 1993Vince Foster was found dead on July 20, 1993Was the suspicious death of Vince Foster and the firing of Republican FBI Director William S. Sessions firing a coincidence? Did President Clinton need an FBI Director who was willing to look the other way when it came to the alleged criminal activities of the Clintons?From NewsMax December 4, 2003 via Free Republic. Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.The FBI never officially investigated the case but simply signed off on the Park Police  probe.  The bureau had little choice. The day before Foster s death, Bill Clinton hurriedly fired the director of the FBI, William Sessions. Sessions later charged that Clinton had  politicized  the bureau.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Louis Freeh coincidentally hired James Comey for his first job.Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.But enough about the crimes of the Clinton s and the hypocrisy of the media who would have chosen to ignore the suspicious timing of President Clinton s firing of his FBI Director William S. Sessions. We should all just ignore the unmitigated mess James Comey made of Hillary s email scandal that put our national security at risk while he was serving as the director of the FBI, and instead, focus on a way to blame Comey s incompetence on President Trump.",politics,2017/5/10,0
0728,CONDOLEEZZA RICE BRILLIANTLY Shuts Down â€œThe Viewâ€?Dingbats Over Trump-Russia Collusion [VIDEO],"On more than one occasion, Condoleezza Rice was able correct the record by pointing out the hypocrisy of these ladies in such a way that they didn t even know it. It started with Trump-hater and ABC senior legal analyst Sunny Hostin asking about General Flynn s alleged discussions with Russia weeks before Trump s inauguration asking,  As someone who has had that position as national security advisor, would you have felt comfortable having those discussions, is that inappropriate?  Rice went on to explain how you will have conversations with foreigners, but the thing you shouldn t do is discuss policy. She then went on to say that,  There s only one president  and that as a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making changes in policy and maybe they should just wait until there s a change in administration. Was Rice referring to the time Obama was caught on a hot mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,  This is my last election, after the election, I ll have more flexibility ?While explaining how we should be handling Vladimir Putin s potential meddling in our elections, Rice reminded the panel that when Hillary was Secretary of State she questioned the legitimacy of Putin s election in 2012 and now he s saying,  I m going to question the legitimacy of your election . Rice s answer wasn t quite what The View hacks had hoped for, and like a dog on a bone, The View host Sunny Hostin continued,  But Madame Secretary, if he [Putin] indeed did engage in these kinds of tactics in the election, then the very legitimacy of our election is at issue isn t it? Rice snapped back,  No. Rice then went on to say,  I trust the people who voted in Wisconsin and Texas and Alabama and California to have voted on the basis of who they thought was best gonna represent their interests. So I m not gonna question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. That s just a step that I m don t think we should take. Let s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they ought to be voting for.  ZING! WATCH:And for the final blow, fake conservative host Jedidiah Bilah  (who, let s face it, is really just collecting a paycheck because she s a token  conservative  who s too weak to stand up for anything) has the opportunity to defend conservatism in some way with one of the most brilliant female conservatives sitting on their panel and she used the opportunity to trash President Trump over his handling of N. Korea. ",politics,2017/5/10,0
0729,DEMOCRAT MAXINE WATERS GOES OFF THE RAILS: Smears Trumpâ€¦Calls Jeff Sessions A Throwback To The Days Of Jim Crow [Video],"This Congresswoman has a potty mouth and a bitter attitude towards whites. She s a hateful racist who is paranoid that everyone is out to get her. She just tossed baseless accusations at the Trump administration in an appearance on The Washington Post podcast  Cape Up with Jonathan Capehart.  (See our previous report on the interview below.)Here are the lowlights:Waters accused President Trump of colluding with Russia during the 2016 election, without offering evidence.  I believe this President has colluded with the Russians, with the Kremlin, with the oligarchs, perhaps, of Russia to undermine our election systems,  Waters told Capehart. (4:00) The California congresswoman also criticized the Senate investigation into Trump-Russia ties as not credible.  They re not moving fast enough!  she exclaimed. However, she praised the media for their investigations into Trump-Russia ties. (4:35) Waters described Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a  throwback to the days of Jim Crow,  equating Sessions with the era of segregation.  I think [Sessions] is a racist and I think he absolutely believes it s his job to keep minorities in their place.  She added that Sessions would like to go back to the days of segregation. (9:30   12:00)As evidence of Sessions  racism, Waters cited an instance where girls in traditional southern dresses greeted Trump and Sessions during the transition period. Waters  implication was that Sessions and Trump enjoyed the clothing because it reminded them of slavery. The group,  The Azalea Trail Maids,  wears colorful traditional dresses to events. (13:50)Capehart finally pushed her to find out if the U.S. government has seen evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.  No, we have not,  Waters said. That means Waters has repeatedly called for Trump s impeachment without yet seeing any evidence of wrongdoing. (20:00)Our previous report on Maxine Waters said the Russia investigation has nothing on Trump:There is probably no one in Congress more openly opposed to President Donald Trump than Maxine Waters. We have already seen that she has called for Trump s impeachment. Therefore when even Waters states there is not yet any evidence at this time of Trump-Russia collusion, that is certainly significant. That is why it is astonishing that Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart left that significant admission made during his own podcast off his May 9 column about it.First let us listen to the segment of Capehart s podcast in which Waters made her surprising admission:How convenient for the left-leaning publication to leave out a direct statement by Maxine Waters. By the way, the title of the article is a rip roaring race baiting title:Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes  it s his job to keep minorities in their place Who does this in 2017? Jeff Sessions is such a good man who DOES NOT deserve such a nasty comment from Congresswoman Waters. Shame on her and shame on Capehart for making this comment the title!JONATHAN CAPEHART: I ve got to ask you, because you leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusions and hacking and all of that. Have you seen anything, either through the intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you ve made?MAXINE WATERS: First of all, don t forget that all of our intelligence agencies say, yes, they have the documentation that they did the hacking on the DNC and on some of us.CAPEHART: But the collusion, though?WATERS: No, we have not. That s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for so-called speeches and who s spent a lot of time in Russia and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?In his column writeup about his podcast interview with Maxine Waters, Capehart tossed that admission of no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion down the memory hole.Via: NTK",politics,2017/5/10,0

KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

0738,THE MOMENT FBI Director James Comey Lost All Credibility [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton was dogged throughout her campaign by her decision to set up a private email server in the basement of her suburban New York home to handle communications as secretary of state. Comey said in July that agents found 110 classified emails containing emails that were classified at the time they were sent or received. That included eight marked  top secret. Although Comey labeled Clinton s behavior  extremely careless,  he added that it did not warrant prosecution.We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton s personal e-mail account.  James Comey on Hillary s server  Lifezette And here is the hilarious version of Comey Vs. Clinton. Enjoy! All kidding aside Even if we assume Comey didn t botch the Clinton email investigation   which is quite an assumption to make, especially considering how outraged so many investigators in the FBI were in the weeks and months following Comey s announcement   why did the FBI director continue to comment on ongoing investigations? Why did he continue to feed red meat to wolves on both sides of the aisle in Congress?The FBI, regardless of Comey s intentions, has now become a blunt political tool that s being wielded by some of the most dishonest, power-hungry people in the country: politicians. That s not only foolish and reckless, it s dangerous to liberty and undermines the credibility of a group of people that must appear credible in the minds of the people for justice to be served and for liberty to endure.The American people deserve better from their FBI director, and if Comey proves to be incapable of exercising greater prudence, perhaps it s time for someone more careful and considerate to take the helm at one of the world s most powerful government agencies. -The Blaze",politics,2017/5/9,0
0739,LIST OF COMEYâ€™S 10 BIGGEST SCREW UPS As FBI Directorâ€¦Why His Firing Was Long Overdue,"Comey will inevitably be remembered for the controversial role he played in the 2016 presidential election, where his agency conducted surveillance of the Trump campaign as well as investigated the Clinton camp for mishandling classified materials, giving both sides arguments for how the FBI ultimately swayed the vote.But even before the 2016 campaign, the FBI endured a number of humiliations under Comey s tenure. Most damning were revelations that the FBI was generally aware of almost every terrorist who successfully struck America over the last eight years.1. Before he bombed the Boston Marathon, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but let him go. Russia sent the Obama Administration a second warning, but the FBI opted against investigating him again.2. Shortly after the NSA scandal exploded in 2013, the FBI was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent Americans; the agency, Bloomberg reported, retains that material for decades (even if no wrongdoing is found).3. The FBI had possession of emails sent by Nidal Hasan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the Taliban   but didn t intervene, leading many critics to argue the tragedy that resulted in the death of 31 Americans at Fort Hood could have been prevented.4. During the Obama Administration, the FBI claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, when in fact they were mostly being used for Eric Holder and Robert Mueller s business and personal travel.5. When the FBI demanded Apple create a  backdoor  that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects, the company refused, sparking a battle between the feds and America s biggest tech company. What makes this incident indicative of Comey s questionable management of the agency is that a) The FBI jumped the gun, as they were indeed ultimately able to crack the San Bernardino terrorist s phone, and b) Almost every other major national security figure sided with Apple (from former CIA Director General Petraeus to former CIA Director James Woolsey to former director of the NSA, General Michael Hayden), warning that such a  crack  would inevitably wind up in the wrong hands.6. In 2015, the FBI conducted a controversial raid on a Texas political meeting, finger printing, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees (some in the group believe in restoring Texas as an independent constitutional republic).7. During its investigation into Hillary Clinton s mishandling of classified material, the FBI made an unusual deal in which Clinton aides were both given immunity and allowed to destroy their laptops.8. The father of the radical Islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in New York City in 2016 alerted the FBI to his son s radicalization. The FBI, however, cleared Ahmad Khan Rahami after a brief interview.9. The FBI also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Despite a more than 10-month investigation of Omar Mateen   during which Mateen admitting lying to agents   the FBI opted against pressing further and closed its case.10. CBS recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill Americans attending the  Draw Muhammad  event in Garland, Texas, the FBI not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but actually had an undercover agent traveling with the Islamists, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The FBI has refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack.Via: Grabien",politics,2017/5/9,0

Dear President Trump,  read the Instagram and Twitter posts.  We re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement. The disaster of climate change is too real, and the threat to our planet and to our children is too great. The move comes on the same day that the president postponed his decision on whether or not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reports CNN. The goal of the agreement is to create  a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 C,  according to European Commission s website.Trump intended on making an announcement before attending the Group of Seven nations summit in Sicily, Italy, on May 26-27, but now, he s going to make a decision after the G7, explained White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Trump has a long history with Tiffany & Co; he named his youngest daughter after the iconic jeweler and the brand s flagship store is connected to Trump Tower in New York.

So if we are to address the Climate crisis we need to challenge the structural causes of the crisis which lies on unequal distribution of wealth, of carbon, and of power. Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power.  -Camille Risler For many years the public at large has been spoonfed the idea that Global Warming Climate Change, is caused by man s excessive release of carbon into the atmosphere. And that the solution to the Climate crisis was to decrease the production of said gas.Over the past several years the Global Warming fanatics have changed their tune. Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and constituency. It is one of the nine official constituencies of the UNFCCC, and we are composed of 15 women s rights and feminist organizations from all around the world. So I m going to begin with kind of an overview of our positions and then I will give the floor over to my colleagues that will go more into details of each section of negotiations.I m Camille Risler. I m from France but I m living in Thailand. I m working for a feminist network that is called Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and I m working for the Climate Justice Program.So what we want to highlight here is that Climate Change is a clear symptom of an unequal and unjust world.

0747,ISLAMIC JUSTICE: Britain Is Stunned When They Discover How Many Secret Sharia Courts Are Operating In UK,"Like dominoes, the Hijra keeps marching across Europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. Sweden and the UK are in big trouble France is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal Democrats in America, the U.S. isn t be far behind At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by British mosques.Mr MacEoin said:  Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts. Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.The report added:  The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK. Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. It said:  Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation. WATCH Muslims demand Shari Law in Britain:The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.Its director Dr David Green said:  The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said:  Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society. There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. We can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law. For entire story: Daily Mail ",politics,2017/5/9,0

Courtney Woods, who is graduating with a master s degree in education policy and management, claimed the event is a way to reclaim Harvard s alleged history  of slavery, epistemic racism and colonization. Woods told The Root,  Harvard s institutional foundation is in direct conflict with the needs of black students. There is a legacy of slavery, epistemic racism and colonization at Harvard, which was an institution founded to train rising imperialist leaders,  she said. This is a history that we are reclaiming.

0760,"#NewOrleans: BLACK PATRIOTS Ready To Fight Antifa For Confederate Monumentsâ€¦Police, Feds Gear Up For Day Of Violence [VIDEO]","May 7th is likely going to be a day of clashes against protesters who are coming from all over the United States to demonstrate against the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. Homeland Security and New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison have promised that they will be arresting anyone who commits or threatens to commit an act of violence. The three locations they ll be watching are: Lee Circle, Congo Square and the Jefferson Davis monument, as  credible threats  have been reportedTension in New Orleans has mounted since the Battle of Liberty Place obelisk was removed early on the morning of April 24, part of an initiative by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, backed by the City Council, to rid New Orleans of what some consider to be tributes to racism. Supporters consider the monuments part of history, and their removal an attempt to erase history.Protestors on both sides clashed at the Jefferson Davis statute this week, prompting police to barricade the monument. Barricades also appeared Friday afternoon at Lee Circle.Landrieu has said statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederacy President Jefferson Davis will come down sometime after the 2017 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival wraps ends Sunday.RADICAL activists like Take  Em Down Nola, a group that has long advocated for the monuments  removal, plans to rally at Congo Square on Sunday at 1:30 p.m then march  to Lee Circle. At least one pro-monument contingent has called for a rally at 11 a.m. at Lee Circle.From the Take  Em Down Nola website:TAKE EM DOWN NOLA CALLS FOR PEOPLES CELEBRATION & SECOND LINE TO BURY WHITE SUPREMACYWhile white supremacists gather from many states around confederate monuments in OUR CITY, the mayor nor council has still not publicly called for its own ceremony to honor the historic occasion of 4 monuments to slavery coming down.  Even the conservative governor of S.C. had a public ceremony to remove the confederate flag. Cowering in darkness offers no safety or protection, it is shameful and being questioned by world wide media.We the people of New Orleans demand that the Mayor and City Council take immediate action to remove all monuments, school names and street signs dedicated to White Supremacists. These structures litter our city with visual reminders of the horrid legacy of slavery that terrorized so many of this city s ancestors. They misrepresent our community. We demand the freedom to live in a city where we are not forced to pay taxes for the maintenance of public symbols that demean us and psychologically terrorize us. We demand:1.That the city release a timeline for the immediate removal of the monuments;  2.That the city expand the definition from 4 specific monuments to encompass all monuments to White Supremacy 3.That the city develop a community driven process for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements.Not everyone agrees with  Take  Em Down Nola  that Confederate statues are a sign of racism. One of the most vocal defenders of the Confederate flag and of the Confederate statues in New Orleans is black female conservative activist Arlene Barnum. Barnum is pictured below with her friend, author and popular pro-Confederate flag speaker Anthony Hervey. Barnum was with when she says he was killed by 4-5 black youths after attending a pro-confederate flag rally in Mississippi.  According to Barnum, she and Hervey were guest speakers at the rally in Mississippi. As they were leaving the rally, the SUV driven by Hervey was chased down by a silver car with 4-5 young black men inside. During the chase, he lost control of his car, it flipped and he was killed. Apparently his life didn t matter to the black community, as they never uttered a word about his suspicious death:PUBLIC NOTICE.. LISTEN UP very carefully. If anyone of you who claim to be pro-Confederate, but who are anti-Confederate Battle flag, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick about it.If you are against the displaying of the Confederate Battle Flag in public, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. Do it now!If you are advocating that people NOT bring Confederate Battle Flag into New Orleans at the endangered Confederate monuments, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick as lickity split!As far as I know, I don t have any BLM folks on my friends list. And when I catch em thru the cracks, I remove & block them with the most extreme prejudice. However, in the case of these self-professed pro Confederate folks who have issues with that battle flag emblem, I will give them the respect, dignity & the curtesy to REMOVE themselves. I m giving them 72 hrs.In photo, the man to the left, Anthony Hervey is a Mississippian who was not afraid to publicly display the Confederate battle flag. As a colored man, he has been vilified, attacked, physically assaulted, called all sorts of racial insults that not even the average white Confederate flaggers had endured. But yet he kept on flagging proudly until the day he was killed. So don t give me that sh*t excuse to justify hiding the Confederate Battle flag to avoid being called a racist. I guarantee you that EVERY colored Confederate flagger I know have been called much worse & treated with violence & are the 1st to be targeted at public venues.You better not be black and support free speech or a Confederate monument in America or expect to be threatened by the left. This is no joke. Facebook user Gene Black threatened a black Confederate statue supporter s family while he s in New Orleans on his wall 4 days ago:Much like ISIS, pro-Confederate monument removal groups like Take  Em Down Nola and communist groups like Antifa plan to come together to threaten free speech and freedom of expression.Black Rebel posted this image with the following message:  words cannot described the friendships built after fighting side by side.  on his Facebook page: Black Rebel also posted this video of an anti-free speech leftist launching a glass bottle, just missing the head of a fellow pro-confederate monument protester. Watch how the police take their time walking over to the area from where the bottle was thrown. You can hear the free speech protesters yelling,  Do something!  to the police officers as they appear to be in no hurry to do anything about it. Let s hope this is not an example of how police plan to respond to any potential acts of violence today, or things are likely to get very ugly very quickly: New Orleans Police Department held a press conference on Saturday where they made the public aware they are planning to keep the citizens of New Orleans safe and will keep the protesters safe from violence and from the threat of violence. Police Chief Harrison also makes it clear that they will take swift action for anyone who violates the law. Chief Harrison also makes clear that while they respect the rights of citizens to open carry weapons in New Orleans, that those weapons are not allowed at a public protest:Watch the response from American Warrior Revolution member to New Orleans Police Chief Harrison s press conference:",politics,2017/5/7,0

0763,BLOCKBUSTER COURT RULING On Obama/Clinton Benghazi Emails Forces The Hand Of The State Department,"Thanks to Judicial Watch for keeping it up with the effort to find out more on what happened in Benghazi. We know that the State Department was and still is protecting Hillary Clinton and Obama. We know that it s hard to keep up the hope that these crooks will be held accountable for what they did. Rest assured that Judicial Watch is calling out the State Department on this and especially Patrick Kennedy (see more on Kennedy below).(Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch today announced that U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has ordered the U.S. Department of State to turn over to Judicial Watch  eight identical paragraphs  of previously redact material in two September 13, 2012, Hillary Clinton emails regarding phone calls made by President Barack Obama to Egyptian and Libyan leaders immediately following the terrorist attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.Both emails had the subject line  Quick Summary of POTUS Calls to Presidents of Libya and Egypt  and were among the emails stored on Clinton s unofficial email server.Judge Jackson reviewed the documents directly and rejected the government s contention that the records had been properly withheld under the FOIA B(5)  deliberative process  exemption.Judge Jackson ruled:  the two records, even if just barely predecisional, are not deliberative. [The State Department] has pointed to very little to support its characterization of these two records as deliberative, and the Court s in camera review of the documents reveals that they do not fall within that category. The full emails may reveal what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama knew about the September 11, 2012, terror attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.Following Judge Jackson s March 20 ruling, the State Department asked the court to reconsider. The State Department argued that, due to an internal  mistake,  it failed to claim that the emails were classified and, therefore, exempt from production under FOIA Exemption B(1).In response, Judicial Watch argues that the failure was not a mistake, but instead was part of a deliberate effort by the State Department to protect Clinton and the agency by avoiding identifying emails on Clinton s unofficial, non-secure email server as classified.Judicial Watch s filing cites an interview of an FBI employee who told federal investigators that top State Department official Patrick Kennedy pressured the FBI to keep Clinton s emails unclassified. The employee told the FBI he  believes STATE ha[d] an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the CLINTON emails in order to protect STATE interests and those of CLINTON. :FBI documents say Kennedy offered the FBI additional positions overseas if the  Secret  label, the middle level of classification, would be removed. Clinton, who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state, has contended she never sent or received classified information. The FBI has ruled otherwise.4 KEY PEOPLE OUT   PARTICULARLY PATRICK KENNEDY:Judicial Watch s filing also cites an interview of a State Department employee who told the FBI that the State Department s Office of Legal Counsel interfered with the FOIA processing of email from Secretary Clinton s server, instructing reviewers to use Exemption B(5) (deliberative process exemption) instead of Exemption B(1) (classified information exemption). According to the FBI interview:STATE s Near East Affairs Bureau upgraded several of CLINTON s emails to a classified level with a B(1) release exemption . [Redacted], along with [Redacted] attorney, Office of Legal Counsel, called STATE s Near East Affairs Bureau and told them they could use a B(5) exemption on a upgraded email to protect it instead of the B(1) exemption. However, the use of the B(5) exemption, which is usually used for executive privilege-related information, was incorrect as the information actually was classified and related to national security, which would be a B(1) exemption.Judicial Watch argues:An agency s deliberate withholding of a FOIA claim, either to gain a tactical advantage or, as appears to be the case here, to protect the agency s interests and those of its former head, is  a motive undoubtedly inconsistent with FOIA s broad remedial purpose   It  counsels denying the Government s request. The emails in question were sent to then-top administration officials, including Clinton, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Clinton Deputy Chief of Staff Jacob Sullivan, Special Assistant Robert Russo, and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough. Does President Trump know his State and Justice Departments are still trying to provide cover for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  An extraordinary court ruling that could result in key answers about the Benghazi outrage is being opposed by the Trump administration. This may well be an example of the  deep state  trying to get away with a cover up   if so then the Trump administration must put a stop to it. Judicial Watch obtained the original documents in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01511)). The lawsuit was filed on September 4, 2014, after the State Department failed to respond to a June 13, 2014, FOIA request seeking:All records related to notes, updates, or reports created in response to the September 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. This request includes, but is not limited to notes taken by then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or employees of the Office of the Secretary of State during the attack and its immediate aftermath. The timeframe for this request is September 11-15, Judicial Watch s numerous FOIA lawsuits have forced the State Department to release hundreds of Benghazi-related documents.THIS IS ALL WE NEED TO SEE TO BE REMINDED TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT FOR TRUTH Via: Judicial Watch",politics,2017/5/6,0

0767,WHY LET THE ATHEISTS Run All Over You? City Removes Bench Honoring Veterans,"A city in Pennsylvania is removing a park bench with a religious quote in order to placate angry atheists. The atheists wants to put their own bench there instead: This bench was put there to honor veterans! Is nothing sacred anymore? The site reads:  The quote by William Penn, appearing on the Tyrants Bench, honors Pennsylvania s founding father, as well as the men and women who gave their lives to protect the rights of all U.S. citizens Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants Does anyone else see the irony in this quote? OIL CITY, Pa.   An atheist group in New Jersey is seeking the removal of a bench at a Pennsylvania park that is meant to honor veterans due to an inscription of a quote attributed to the state s founder that mentions God. American Atheists (AA) recently sent a letter to the mayor of Oil City to request that the Justus Park bench, which was donated in 2003 by a local branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), be removed out of its belief that its inscribed text violates the U.S. Constitution.  Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants,  the bench reads, paraphrasing a quote that is often attributed to Pennsylvania founder William Penn, a Quaker who wrote a number of theological books and who once stood trial for  causing a tumult  in preaching in the streets. AA contends that the quote violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which instructs that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.  The group also says the text is disrespectful to non-Christians. The Tyrants Bench contains an overtly religious message which endorses one particular religious viewpoint: Christianity. The statement that  Men who aren t governed by God will be governed by tyrants  not only has absolutely nothing to do with honoring our service members, but is derisive toward the all non-Christian American service members who have served and died for this country,  its letter asserted. It offered to provide a secular bench in exchange for the current display.Read more: Christian News",politics,2017/5/6,0

0779,STEPHEN COLBERTâ€™S RESPONSE To His Vulgar Remarks About Trump Made Americans Want Him Fired Even Moreâ€?FireColbert [VIDEO],"Johnny Carson must be rolling over in his grave to see what s happened to late night comedy where he dedicated 30 years of his life to actually making people of all political persuasions laugh. If Johnny Carson had a particular political leaning, his viewers wouldn t have known what it was. When it came to criticizing President s of the United States, he was always funny but never hateful and certainly never vile. A lot has changed since then. It wasn t so long ago that  comedians  like Stephen Colbert only dreamed of sitting in one of the coveted late night comedy spots like the one Johnny Carson created. David Letterman s hate for conservatives and Republicans didn t really surfaced until he was nearing the end of his career, and although many wish he would keep his hateful opinions about our President to himself, he is a private citizen now and is not accountable to anyone for his petty remarks. The big question is, will anyone at CBS hold his predecessor Stephen Colbert responsible for his vile remarks about Trump having oral sex with Vladimir Putin? Will Colbert s advertisers pull their advertising dollars from his show like they did to FOX News  Bill O Reilly, after unproven allegations of sexual assault were made against him?As sad as it was to the world of comedy when Johnny Carson passed away, it s a good thing he isn t able to see how that the hateful and spiteful liberal Stephen Colbert has disgraced and replaced what once was considered late-night comedy.Last night, Stephen Colbert responded to #FireColbert backlash over a crude oral-sex joke he made about President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday, May 1. Trump supporters and others thought the comment was inappropriate and called for the comedian to be dropped from the CBS show.The TV host, 52, opened his Wednesday, May 3, episode by addressing the controversy.  Welcome to The Late Show,  he said.  I m your host, Stephen Colbert. Still? I am still the host? I m still the host! Colbert went on to explain that his scathing monologue was spurred by Trump abruptly ending an Oval Office interview with fellow CBS correspondent John Dickerson.  Now, if you saw my monologue Monday, you know that I was a little upset at Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine,  he said.  So at the end of that monologue, I had a few choice insults for the president in return. I don t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes.

0782,BREAKING NEWS: GOP Controlled House Votes To REPEAL Obamacare,"After years of debate, the House on Thursday voted to repeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with new provisions.The vote, which President Donald Trump was planning to tout as a big victory, sends the Republican-sponsored bill to gut Obamacare to the Senate for consideration.But winning approval for the bill could be even more difficult in the Senate than it has been in the House, where Republican leaders struggled for nearly two months to wrangle enough votes in their caucus to secure its passage.The bill passed by a vote of 217 to 213. All 193 Democrats voting opposed the bill; they were joined by 20 Republicans voting  no. A lot of us have waited seven years to case this vote,  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said shortly before the voting began.  Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this vote: to repeal and replace Obamacare. This bill delivers the promises we have made to the American people,  Ryan said.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told MSNBC shortly before the vote began,  We were elected to do this. After the vote, protesters outside the Capitol building yelled,  Shame, shame!  at members of Congress walking down the front steps.  CNBCWashington Free Beacon   One of the amendments, introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.), co-chair of the Tuesday Group, allows states to obtain a waiver from federal standards such as essential health benefits and community rating rules. This measure gained the support of House Freedom Caucus members, who said it will significantly lower health costs, even if it does not fully repeal Obamacare. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA,  said the House Freedom Caucus.  While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower health care costs. Another amendment, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) adds $8 billion to the Patient and State Stability Fund, which helps reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs. This amendment would provide additional funding, $8 billion over five years, to ensure a strong safety net and reduce premiums, or other out-of-pocket costs, for those with preexisting conditions,  said Upton.Following the amendment, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the White House supported the measure and that President Trump has been working to ensure that Americans have more affordable care. Overall the efforts that were made, and especially the effort this morning with congressmen Long and Upton, help bring more people into this effort and make it even a stronger bill, and ensure that Americans have a health care system that gets them the care that they need at a price that s affordable,  Spicer said. The president has been on the phone constantly,  Spicer said.  I think we have made this an unbelievable bill and an unbelievable replacement for Obamacare, which is failing, and that s what we ve sought to do from the beginning. ",politics,2017/5/4,0

He asked random people walking down the street if they would sign a petition to  support violent criminals to be released from our prisons and onto our streets. It s interesting to see how many people accept that illegal aliens in our prisons are not being treated unfairly without any evidence. This false narrative was successfully promoted by Barack Obama, our media and the Democrats, who decided that illegal aliens should be not just be given equal treatment to American citizens, but instead, they should be given special treatment above and beyond those afforded to American citizens.Watch the video and check out the new statistics below that were just released by Zogby, showing that Hispanics in America now support President Trump more than any other demographic. Apparently supporting illegal aliens who commit crimes in America is no longer cool under a Trump administration:Most of the people who are seen signing this petition, are Hispanic. But that s when we had a president who shamed Americans into believing that giving special privileges to illegal aliens was expected. Today however, is a different story In its latest survey, Zogby Analytics said that Hispanic support has hit 45 percent, two points higher than the president s generic approval.That is 55 percent higher than the total Latino vote for Trump in the election. He won just 29 percent. The biggest surprise in this new poll is Trump s approval among Hispanic voters, which is at 45 percent approval/51 percent disapproval. In February the numbers were less among Hispanics at 39 percent approval/53 percent disapproval,  said Zogby.Via: Washington Examiner ",politics,2017/5/4,0

The two words that stand out are the words  mildly nauseous :FBI director James Comey said he s  mildly nauseous  about the possibility that his announcement about reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails influenced the outcome of the election  Tessa Berenson, Time (time.com), 3 May 2017Tucker Carlson interviewed US Attorney Joe diGenova:DOES THE FBI DIRECTOR HAVE TOO MUCH POWER?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzdGKmo3-A8diGenova was on fire during this interview:  I got mildly nauseous listening to his testimony one more time,  diGenova said, referring to Comey s own feelings about possibly affecting the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. James Comey is a danger to the country,  diGenova said.  He surrounds himself with his own cult of personality. He believes that he is the last righteous man left standing. When Comey held a news conference July 5, 2016 where he  accused Hillary Clinton and then exonerated her,  diGenova said,  he violated every rule and regulation of the department of justice. He should have been fired that day. President Donald Trump should not have kept him after his inauguration, he added. He should be fired for the testimony that he has given over the last few months,  diGenova added.  That July 5 news conference was the original sin. From it, everything else followed. In answer to Comey s question to his critics of what they would have done differently, diGenova said,  Mr. Director, I would have done nothing, because I never would have held the July 5 news conference, which forced you to send two letters to Congress. Comey, as FBI director, is a cop, he said, but instead took on the role of a prosecutor, stealing the job of the Justice Department. But the Justice Department, headed then by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, was left unable to respond because of Lynch s private meeting with Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, in Clinton s plane at the Phoenix airport. The entire Department of Justice was so frightened of Jim Comey because of the way they had politically mishandled the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, that they were afraid to contradict him,  he said.  That is what you call a disaster in a government of accountability. He stole the work of the Department of Justice in a single day, and they sat there and watched it. A pox on all of their houses.

0787,NEW BIOGRAPHY Exposes Barack Obamaâ€™s Dream Of Becoming Donald Trump,"Barack Obama s white college girlfriend Sheila Miyoshi Jager, who is now a professor at Oberlin College, tells a story of a very calculating man who was not about to let her race get in the way of his political ambitions: In the winter of  86, when we visited my parents, he asked me to marry him,  she told Garrow. Her parents were opposed, less for any racial reasons (Barack came across to them like  a white, middle-class kid,  a close family friend said) than for concern about Obama s professional prospects, and because her mother thought Sheila, two years Obama s junior, was too young.  Not yet,  Sheila told Barack. But they stayed together.In early 1987, when Obama was 25, she sensed a change.  He became. . . so very ambitious  very suddenly,  she told Garrow.  I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president. Discussions of race and politics suddenly overwhelmed Sheila and Barack s relationship.  The marriage discussions dragged on and on,  but now they were clouded by Obama s  torment over this central issue of his life . . . race and identity,  Sheila recalls. The  resolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,  she said.At Harvard, the Obama the world has come to know took clearer form. In his late 20s now and slightly older than most classmates, he had a compulsion to orate in class and summarize other people s arguments for them.  In law school the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up,  one student told Garrow. Classmates created a Obamanometer, ranking  how pretentious someone s remarks are in class. If Garrow is indeed correct in concluding that Obama s romantic choices were influenced by his political ambitions, it is no small irony that Michelle Obama became one of those most skeptical about Obama s political prospects, and most dubious about his will to rise. She constantly discourages his efforts toward elective office and resents the time he spends away from her and their two young daughters. Obama vented to a friend how often Michelle would talk about money.  Why don t you go out and get a good job? You re a lawyer   you can make all the money we need,  she would tell him, as the couple struggled with student loans and the demands of family and political life. (Garrow sides with Michelle, highlighting how, on the day after Sasha was born, Barack went downtown for a meeting.)As he considered a U.S. Senate bid, Obama s team commissioned a poll that covered, among other questions, his name.  Barry,  as he was known from childhood into his early college years, polled better than  Barack,  but Obama never considered resurrecting the old name. He had made his choice, of identity and image, long ago. Sheila recalls that one of the few times Obama became genuinely angry with her was in Hawaii, when she heard relatives calling him Barry, and she did so as well, just for fun. He became  irrationally furious,  she said.  He told me that under no circumstances was I ever to use that name with him. There was no going back.The sense of destiny is not unusual among those who become president. (See Clinton, Bill.) But it created complications. Obama believed that he had a  calling,  Garrow writes, and in his case it was  coupled with a heightened awareness that to pursue it he had to fully identify as African American. Obama had considered Donald Trump long before either man won the presidency, and brushed off his existence as a misguided national fantasy. Americans have a  continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility,  Obama wrote in the old Harvard book manuscript, now more than 25 years old.  The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American   I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don t make it, my children will.

Rice, in response to Senator Graham s invitation to Ambassador Rice to testify at a May 8, 2017 hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism entitled  Russian Interference in the 2016 United States Election. While Ambassador Rice commends the Subcommittee s efforts to examine this matter of extraordinary national significance, it is extremely rare for the Congress to request the testimony of a former senior advisor to the President given the longstanding and well-recognized separation of powers concerns at issue. Moreover, Chairman Graham s invitation was extended only after the hearing was noticed, less than two weeks before the hearing was scheduled to occur, and without consultation with Ambassador Rice, a professional courtesy that would customarily be extended to any witness. Notwithstanding the significance of these concerns, Ambassador Rice is prepared to assist Congressional inquiries into Russian election interference because of the important national interests at stake, provided they are conducted in a bipartisan manner, and as appropriate, in classified session.In this case, however, Senator Whitehouse has informed us by letter that he did not agree to Chairman Graham s invitation to Ambassador Rice, a significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses. Under these circumstances, Ambassador Rice respectfully declines Senator Graham s invitation to testify.Again, and as Ambassador Rice has stated publicly, she supports and is committed to assisting the bipartisan Congressional inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election, given the utmost importance of this matter to our national security.Please contact me if you have any questions.

He shares for the first time the story of a woman Obama lived with and loved in Chicago, in the years before he met Michelle, and whom he asked to marry him. Sheila Miyoshi Jager, now a professor at Oberlin College, is a recurring presence in  Rising Star,  and her pained, drawn-out relationship with Obama informs both his will to rise in politics and the trade-offs he deems necessary to do so. Narrow, who received a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Martin Luther King Jr., concludes this massive new work with a damning verdict on Obama s determination:  While the crucible of self-creation had produced an ironclad will, the vessel was hollow at its core.  -The Washington PostObama slept with his girlfriend Genevieve Cook on their first date, before she wrote him a poem about their  f***ing  and called their sex  passionate , the book about the former president reveals.They also took cocaine together   and after they split she slept with his best friend.Obama also considered a gay relationship while at college, twice proposed to another white girlfriend, and cheated on Michelle with his ex during the first year of their relationship. Obama, a new Columbia graduate who was working for a firm that  prepared financial reports at the time, made dinner for Cook at his apartment in Manhattan two weeks after meeting her at a New Year s Eve party and handing her his phone number.It was the start of a relationship which is one of a series revealed in Rising Star.It was written after exhaustive research by Pulitzer-prize winning biographer David Garrow, and also reveals how he asked another woman to marry him   and continued a relationship with her while dating Michelle, before she became his wife.Cook was 25 when she met 22-year-old Obama on New Year s Eve in 1983.Australian-born Cook was living in her mother and stepfather s Park Avenue apartment at the time, but had been brought up around the world, including   like Obama, Indonesia   as her father was an Australian spy and diplomat.But the couple also used drugs and Cook reveals that Obama was still a cocaine user when they were together.He would spend time with other friends   Hasan Chandoo, Imad Hussain and Sohale Siddiqi, who he had been friends with at Occidental College, in Los Angeles   and Cook said the trio was taking  lots of cocaine .They were far more prolific users than Obama, who she said probably preferred staying home to read than taking the drug. Chandoo   who was later to become a fundraiser for Obama   was the leader, the book claims. For every five lines that somebody did, he would have done half,  Cook said.The book also notes that Cook and Obama would smoke pot but only at parties and records one time when during tension in their relationship she wrote in her diary that they went to a party and got  high  on cocaine.That Obama was still using cocaine in his early 20s is a significant revelation.He had previously only disclosed that he used it as a teenage student.The couple split in June 1985, after a year and a half together, the book says.But she was hardly out of his life   because she became involved with his friend Sohale in September of that year.She and Sohale did ecstasy together, and then had sex. When she wrote to Obama and told him he replied:  The news of Sohale and you did hurt. He also used   possibly inadvertently   a racial slur to refer to Sohale and the other two Pakistani-born friends, calling them  the Pakis  in the same letter.",politics,2017/5/3,0
0790,"WATCH SEAN SPICER Slam Hillary With Great Sports Analogy On Election Loss: â€œLook, Iâ€™m a Patriots fanâ€¦â€?[Video]","Sean Spicer gave Hillary Clinton a little dig when he used the analogy of the Falcons vs Patriots game to explain the election last year. You ll love this! It s in response to Clinton s ridiculous claim that the press and Comey were to blame for her loss (see below). She needs to just go away! It s somewhat sad that we re still debating that the president won in the fashion he did Amen to that!The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",politics,2017/5/3,0

It s interesting that Anderson praised Melania for not wearing fur to the inauguration because the First Lady has been pictured many times wearing fur. An unlikely cause or has Melania gone anti-fur? It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace   Pamela AndersonOn Wednesday, the Baywatch alum shared a letter she received from the first lady.  Dear Melania, Thank you for your sweet note,  Anderson tweeted alongside an image of the letter.  It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace. The note from Melania Trump thanked Anderson for sending a  beautiful eco-faux fur  from Russian faux-fur manufacturer Only Me. Melania Trump s letter concluded,  I am grateful for your support and encouraging words; they mean a great deal. Together, we can empower more women to stand up for their beliefs. Anderson sent the gift to FLOTUS in February, with a note that read,  Amid all the mania at the inauguration, you looked stunning in an outfit by Ralph Lauren   one of many fur-free designers. I am so happy that you chose not to wear fur! As first lady, you will help set style trends, and by remaining compassionate with your choices, you will warm the hearts of many.

Jessica told Hopkins,  My husband is turning into a man I don t recognize anymore because of what he has physically seen. Jessica added that it was the way male migrants behaved in particular, that led to his change of heart.She told Katie:  It was a really, really traumatic time for him. He was doing three-week stints and they were picking bodies out of the sea. Babies, women, it was awful. But at the same time, he said they were processing men, adults, in their 30s who all had phones with Isis stuff on the phones, they were being separated. When they were being handed over to the authorities with the information explaining that these guys had all this on their phones, and what their ages were, and they were just being processed through. There was nothing, they were just being separated out, they just all went through with everything else, it broke his heart, because he was dealing with families who were in such a terrible state with young babies who so clearly needed rescuing. And yet you had adult males that were pushing women and children to the back of the queue they felt that they were more important. It s just an awful situation, and this was last year. He can t handle the way these women and children are treated by these men. There were hundreds and hundreds of women, children, men who were being picked out of the sea. Not all of them were refugees. He came home heartbroken. Absolutely heartbroken, because he s saying  I don t know how Europe is going to cope .She continued:  How are we supposed to process that as individuals? You know, he still has images that he has to deal with over a year later. We forget about the medics who deal with this, the soldiers that are dealing with this. The people that are processing these people. It s not just how are we going to process all these people, but how are we going to deal with the trauma of having to process these people? Having to make these decisions? Who do you treat first? A special thank you to Paul Joseph Watson for this video: Man who helped rescue  refugees  said many were men with ISIS content on phones who shoved women & children out of the way. pic.twitter.com/wH08TLf4xY  Paul Joseph Watson  (@PrisonPlanet) May 3, 2017Katie asked the caller how her husband is doing currently after seeing the vast number of migrants rescued this year already.Jessica said:  My husband is turning into, it s why I stopped him doing it, he s turning into a man I don t recognise anymore. Because my family think I m a bleeding heart liberal, and you know, I would just wave everyone in and say  come on, we ll help , and my husband was of a very similar opinion that people needed help. He s now turning into someone I don t recognise, because of what he has physically seen. He is starting to say this is not all people looking for help, there are people here who are out for their own self interest. She added:  It s just awful. And now he is building a hatred of a certain demograph[ic], that he has been exposed to because he s seen the way they behave.   LBCIs it too late for Europe? Have they allowed this unabated invasion of migrants from majority Muslim nations to their once  culturally distinct nations for too long? What will these bleeding heart nations look like in 5 years? How long will Americans sit back and allow bleeding heart liberals to call them  racists  or  xenophobes  because they don t want to see the fundamental transformation of the United States that Barack Obama promised would happen if we elected him as our president.

0794,IRAN MAKES MAJOR Announcement About How They Plan To Use BILLIONS In â€œOBAMA-BUCK$â€?[VIDEO],"Iran is using the billions in cash resources provided under the landmark nuclear deal to engage in an unprecedented military buildup meant to transform the Islamic Republic s fighting force into an  offensive  juggernaut, according to a largely unreported announcement by Iranian military leaders that has sparked concern among U.S. national security insiders and sources on Capitol Hill.The shocking truth behind the US-Iran nuclear deal, as WSJ reports, is that John Kerry and the Obama Administration airlifted $1.7bn of cash in  compromise  payments (read   bribe) to Tehran to ensure the release of 4 captured sailors coincidentally the same weekend as the signing of the nuclear deal.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.Of course, senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo.  Zero HedgeIt now appears that Obama s chickens are coming home to roost Iranian officials announced late last month that Iran s defense budget had increased by 145 percent under President Hassan Rouhani and that the military is moving forward with a massive restructuring effort aimed at making it  a forward moving force,  according to regional reports.Iranian leaders have stated since the Iran deal was enacted that they are using the massive amounts of cash released under the agreement to fund the purchase of new military equipment and other armaments. Iran also has pursued multi-million dollar arms deals with Russia since economic sanctions were nixed as part of the deal.Leading members of Congress and U.S. officials working on the Iran portfolio suspect that at least a portion of the Obama administration s $1.7 billion cash payment to Iran  has been used to fund and support terrorists in the Middle East.The latest disclosure about Iran s military buildup is further fueling concerns that U.S. cash assets returned to the country which were released with no strings attached by the Obama administration are helping Iran pursue a more aggressive military stance against U.S. forces in the region. President Obama flat-out caved in to Iran when he handed them the disastrous nuclear deal and $1.7 billion in cash payments that could assist Iran s military,  Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.), an opponent of the nuclear deal, told the Washington Free Beacon.  So it s no surprise that the world s lead sponsor of terrorism would feel emboldened to become more aggressive in the region and flex its military muscle. Iranian Brigadier General Kiumars Heidari announced the military buildup during Iran s annual Army Day. While the announcement did not grab many headlines in the Western media, national security insiders have been discussing the announcement for weeks, according to conversations with multiple sources.Iran s goal is to turn its army into an  offensive  force, a major shift from its historic role as a support agent for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC, Iran s extremely well funded primary fighting force.For entire story: Washington Free Beacon",politics,2017/5/3,0

0797,Proposed Budget Deal Is MUCH WORSE On U.S. Border Security Than We Originally Thought,"Only a few days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation s immigration policies Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and block federal grants from immigrant-protecting  sanctuary cities. Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders,  Trump declared during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security.  We are going to save lives on both sides of the border. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics.   PBSAlthough the source of funding for a border wall was never really clear, most Americans believed with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate, funding for a secure border wall, as part of our national security was a no-brainer. Conservative Review   The proposed budget deal before the House of Representatives is playing out like a bad replay of the latter Obama era: A Republican-controlled Congress   given the power of the purse by the American people   giving away the farm to Democrat demands.But the capitulation is far worse than one may realize. It s not just the lack of new funding for a southern border wall; this omnibus, which funds countless liberal priorities, prohibits existing funds from being used on any sort of border wall as well.According to a Congressional Research Service report from January, the Department of Homeland Security could have taken non-obligated funds and used them to put structures along areas of the border already spelled out in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandating a double-layered fence. Indeed, nothing in current law would appear to bar DHS from installing hundreds of miles of additional physical barriers,  it contends,  at least so long as this action was determined appropriate to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry or was deemed warranted to achieve  operational control  of the southern border. It s important to remember that the requirement to construct  no less than 700 miles  of border fencing (originally 850 miles) has been the law on the books for over a decade. Obama used waiver authority and very loose discretion (thanks to the weakening of the law in 2008) to skirt the requirement.Now that Trump wants to fulfill the existing mandate, Congress really has a moral obligation to honor the existing statutory authorization with sufficient appropriations. This is not some Trump boondoggle; this is a law passed with major bipartisan support in 2006.What the current proposal does is not only not fund a border wall, but it s so specifically worded as to prohibit any of the currently allocated funds from going to construction on the project. The bill actually rescinds $21 million in unobligated funds for border fencing.This means that even previous resources cannot be used on new construction as well, thereby tying the administration s hands and essentially weakening current law. Without this language, Trump could theoretically begin entering into contracts so that by the time the September funding bill is signed, he can hit the ground running with new funding (not that he will fight then, either). So, rather than take what money exists and use that to start negotiating contracts, run studies, and do whatever else is conceivable on physical border security between now and when Congress revisits this never-ending budget circus in September, nothing except for maintenance on the current, insufficient structure will be permitted.Meanwhile, the current budget retains provisions either providing funds specifically for, or predicating them upon, border security in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Pakistan, Libya, Ethiopia, and other countries  affected by extremism. That is not to say that the security of these borders against the likes of jihadists aren t our concern, or that these provisions ought not to exist. Assisting in physically stopping the flow of terrorist arms and personnel across borders is but one basic tool to be employed in the global fight against Sharia supremacism. But the juxtaposition of these is telling.A Republican Congress is willing to pass a bill that realizes border security is necessary for countries across the ocean, but will sacrifice not only a symbol of our own sovereignty, but a physical means of protecting it (the only effective way of tackling the policy and political problems with open borders).

0800,BLACK STUDENT With Hot Glue Gun Causes Elite LIBERAL COLLEGE To Lock-Down Campus,"After a sighting of black student with a hot glue gun caused the tolerant, liberal campus of Colgate quickly jumped into action and locked down the school. The university president took swift action, blamed the Campus Safety Director and quickly placed him on administrative leave until an investigation is completed. There have been no shots fired Colgate University locked down its campus today, after a student spotted an  armed individual  who was actually holding a hot glue gun.The upstate New York university s official Twitter account tweeted out a warning late Monday urging students to seek shelter. The tweets warned there was an  armed person  on campus, although there were  no reports of shots fired. But shortly before midnight, the lockdown was lifted. In a statement to students, Colgate announced that  after thorough investigation, and with the assistance of the person in question, law enforcement identified the individual as a student who was using a glue gun for an art project. Students on social media quickly reported that the glue-toting student was African-American, and grumbled that race may have played a factor. In an additional statement Tuesday morning, Colgate President Brian W. Casey confirmed the student s race and apologized.

Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Campus safety officials report there have been no shots fired. Situation is still under investigation. Updates as available.  Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Colgate University President made the following statement: This morning I received an update from Campus Safety regarding the events of last night, details of which I want to share with the campus. Please know that I have called for a thorough, deeper review of all matters related to last night from the original reporting of the events to the University s response. I will have this report within ten days and I will share its findings with the campus.At a few minutes before 8 PM last night a Colgate student called Colgate Campus Safety reporting that they had seen a black male entering the Coop, carrying what appeared to be a gun. A few minutes later, Campus Safety sent out the first of two campus announcements, the first identifying an  Emergency Situation  and the second indicating, in a profound error, that there was an active shooter on the campus. (The remaining campus notices last night were sent out by our Communications Office and an emergency response team.)After the initial report, Campus Safety contacted local law enforcement units, which proceeded to engage in steps associated with reports of a person with a gun in a public setting. Only after it was determined that the person in the Coop was a Colgate student who had a glue gun needed for an art project was Campus Safety able to end the campus lockdown.To more fully understand the events of last night, we are in contact with the student who had the glue gun and will be with the student who made the initial report. Importantly, I am also in contact with those who were making the essential administrative decisions last night.It is important that we understand the role that implicit racial bias had in the initial reporting of and responses to the events of last night. I want to make sure we speak with those who made and received the initial report to understand the role this played.More egregiously, perhaps, was the effect profiling had on the response of safety officers and other University offices to these events. In addition, communication and enforcement steps were taken that, I believe, confused and harmed this campus and our students. As a first step, I have asked Campus Safety Director Bill Ferguson, who was leading university security efforts last night, to take an administrative leave from his position effective immediately while we conduct a review of the events of last night.This has been a difficult, painful several hours on this campus. My obligation is, first, to demand a full accounting of what happened. My next obligation is to take steps to ensure the safety of all Colgate students, faculty and staff. My final obligation my desire is to improve Colgate. If there is anything that can and should come from these events it must be that concrete steps are taken to make Colgate a better place, and a university worthy of both regard and respect.

Daniel Llorente is the brave pro-American Cuban dissident who interrupted Monday s May Day parade in Havana, running in front of the marching throngs waving an American flag. A communist mob attacked him, beating him and dragging him away.The man, identified as Daniel Llorente, has previously waged similar protests against the communist regime of dictator Ra l Castro and has expressed vocally his support for the American government.Video of the incident shows that Llorente took off running in front of the throngs, waving an American flag before the likeness of mass murderer Ernesto  Che  Guevara in the Plaza of the Revolution, waiting to march just moments before the May Day parade was to begin, shouting anti-government slogans. A group of men waiting on the sidelines, who have not been identified in reports, restrained, beat, and dragged Llorente away. Every major Cuban government leader, including dictator Castro, was in attendance.The Miami-based outlet Mart  Noticias identified the man as Llorente, a freelance cab driver and dissident, but does not belong to any dissident organizations. Instead, he has used his American flag to protest on previous occasions by waving it before public congregations. A year ago, Llorente protested before a crowd awaiting the first American cruise ship s arrival in Havana, the Adonia. Llorente greeted the ship waving an American flag and shouting  Yes we can! , the famous slogan of President Barack Obama s first presidential campaign. The government organized a rabble to berate Llorente with racial epithets, and Llorente responded by asserting his freedom.Read more: Breitbart",politics,2017/5/2,0
0802,HILLARY GIVES HILARIOUS Reason For Losing Election: â€œI Was On The Way To Winningâ€?[VIDEO],"The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",politics,2017/5/2,0
0803,HOW PAUL RYAN JUST Made A Mockery Of Trumpâ€™s Promise To Protect Blue-Collar Jobs From Foreign Workers,"The bipartisan congressional language creates a headache for Trump and his deputies because it flips the politically difficult problem from Congress to the Department of Homeland Security of deciding whether to provide extra wage-cutting H-2B contract workers to companies or else to improve job opportunities for Trump s blue-collar voters.The new rule helps business groups offset rising pressure for wage increases, just 18 months before the mid-term elections when voters will vet the success or not of Trump s  Buy American, Hire American  policies.The H-2B language was hidden deep in the draft 2017 supplemental budget   which is to face House and Senate votes this week   and it surprised opponents of the legislation. In December 2016, Ryan had agreed to trim the program when the partial 2017 budget deal was announced just one month after blue-collar voters backed Donald Trump s campaign promise of a low-immigration, high-wage national economic policy.Apparently nothing is going to change, as long as Speaker Ryan remains at the helm.

0804,EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HEAR THIS: Radical Democrat Chair Openly Reveals The Shocking Agenda Of The Democrat Party During May Day Speech [Video],"Tom Perez decided to go there yesterday when he said during his May Day speech that  no human being is illegal .So now the Democrats are coming out with the truth they are openly advocating for open borders. Pretty unbelievable, huh? They used to at least attempt to hide the fact that they are for open borders, but now it s out in the open. Could it be that the Dem Chariman Tom Perez is connected to the pro-open borders radical group La Raza?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFoLUXm3gQoTom Perez has been going around spouting profanity against the Republicans in a new effort to try and win votes we think this is great for the Republicans. Who wants to hear profanity laden speeches?One of the latest speeches with profanity showed a young kid right next to Perez during the speech! Who does that?Perez refused to say President Trump s name: Our most important power is not the mister in the White House, I can t even mention his name, the power is with all of you He then claimed that no one is illegal: No human being is illegal, we must treat everyone with dignity DNC Chair Tom Perez was on MSNBC (video below) to answer to critics who didn t like his nasty speech:He appeared at an event held by New Jersey Working Families Alliance, a re-branded ACORN agency and gave a hateful and divisive speech. He claimed that, Republicans don t give a sh*t about people . Why the Democrats picked this far left radical is puzzling unless the Democrats plan on going full commie Perez is connected to the radical open borders group La Raza. Something tells us that Obama made this pick for the Democrats.Check out a defiant Perez doubling down on is nastiness:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT BELOW:Newly elected Democrat Chair Tom Perez went a little bonkers with a rant on how he wants the Dems to think Trump didn t win the election. The Democrats are trying to discredit Trump at every turn but they re losing. The American people want good policy and NOT political turmoil. That s exactly why Trump won! People are sick to death of this type of outright lying to sway people to your side.Perez has a long radical history connected to La Raza and other open borders organizations. His track record  is full on radical. e s in cahoots with Obama to continue the  fundamental transformation  of America. Anyone who s a Democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction. Do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for Dem Chair.He just fired all Democrat Party staffers and is bringing in all new people. The party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any American. ",politics,2017/5/2,0

They were successful in threatening the city of Portland until they shut down a traditional parade:PORTLAND ANTIFA SHUTS DOWN TRADITIONAL PARADE:The irony in this entire cancellation of a tradition in Portland, Oregon is that now the Antifa (Anti Fascists) have pissed off the more moderate lefties. One group was going to speak at the parade event against white supremacy but now they won t get the chance. It s turning out that the Antifa group is more violent than any other radical group we ve known. They re even selling knives on their website!  A threatening email has derailed one of the Portland Rose Festival s signature events, and spurred new debate about the ongoing political protests in Portland.Organizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade announced Tuesday that the event will be canceled, for fear that the east Portland parade could be disrupted by  the type of riots which happen in downtown Portland.  (see video below)Originally scheduled this Saturday, April 29, the parade is meant to highlight the local community and businesses along Southeast 82nd Avenue, aiming to turn around the negative perception many people have of the area. It started in 2007 and has since become a popular event on the Rose Festival calendar.This year s parade was once again set to feature the Multnomah County Republican Party as one of the many groups slated to march, but that inclusion drew ire from some of the city s left-leaning protest groups.At least two protests were planned for the day of the parade, one by Oregon Students Empowered and another by Direct Action Alliance. Both events were mentioned in an email sent to parade organizers on Saturday, threatening to shut down the event with hundreds of protesters in the street. You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,  the anonymous email said, telling organizers they could cancel the Republican group s registration or else face action from protesters.  This is non-negotiable. The parade is organized by the 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association, a part of the neighborhood business organization Venture Portland. Representatives from neither organization returned calls for comment.The cancelation isn t necessarily a win for the protest groups. Jacob Bureros, an organizer with the Direct Action Alliance, said the organization   which intended to speak out against fascism and white supremacy during the parade   is sad to hear the news. We are disappointed that the parade was canceled,  he said.  We re members of this community and this is an awesome parade. James Buchal, chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, said his group was ready to march despite the protesters. He said the party had no hand in cancelling the event, and was taken by surprise when they heard the news. After seeing the email last weekend, they had no plans to back out. We weren t willing to just walk away quietly,  he said.  The next thing we knew the whole thing was canceled. The problem is the police said they couldn t offer additional security for the parade so the organizers backed out. We know the Portland Police Department can move to stop this type of activity.Check out this recent shut down of protesters blocking a bus in downtown Portland:Portland protesters were doing the usual idiotic tactic of blocking the street and not letting traffic proceed What they didn t realize is that the police aren t taking this anymore Watch the takedown of these punks Awesome!Check out the lady with the thumbs up!

The first 5 minutes of Warren s yawn-inducing interview is filled with whining about how her progressive agenda is being ignored and how capitalism needs to be addressed and taken down.Maher quickly reminds her that from 1980-2015 when many of the economy-killing regulations were implemented that many Democrats were responsible for passing. He asked her,  Don t the Democrats bear some responsibility for that?
