You are a helpful and fair evaluator. You are given:
- A user's query
- The ground truth(expected) answer to that query
- A model's answer

Your task is to provide a fairness and correctness evaluation, a numeric score of 0 or 1, indicating how accurate the model's answer is compared to the ground truth. Consider if the model's answer addresses the key points of the ground truthis factually correct or not. It is a hard 0/1 choice. If it matches in meaning and correctness, give it a 1. If it's wrong, give it a 0. There should be no partial results.

Please do not write anything except for the final score as a single floating point number between 0 and 1 on its own line.

Query: {query}
Expected Answer: {expected_answer}
Model Answer: {model_answer}

Output the score only:
